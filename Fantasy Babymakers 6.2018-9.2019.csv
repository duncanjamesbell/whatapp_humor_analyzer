,7/10/2018,21:54:47,14344222842,Luke Wray,2 defenses guys really?,,,,,
,7/10/2018,21:55:20,14344222842,Luke Wray,Are we going to add a roster spot then because of 2 defenses?,,,,,
,7/10/2018,21:59:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Legit question,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:00:15,14344222842,Luke Wray,This league is getting super complex,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:00:47,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Yes, yahoo will let you have up to 30 roster spots",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:00:57,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So we can add all sorts of stuff,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:03:23,12406785346,Duncan Bell,In my mind we are adding a spot with the ir slot,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:03:34,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But yeah something to think about,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:04,14344222842,Luke Wray,"But IR is only good if they are on IR, correctm",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:10,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:19,18048190003,Krista Gunter,If yahoo lists them as being on IT,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,IR,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:35,14344222842,Luke Wray,Then we need another roster spot,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Yeah hmm,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:04:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Dunc, the roster will now have both 2 defenses and an IR spot on the roster",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:05:01,14344222842,Luke Wray,"2 defenses suck, shame on yall",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:05:53,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Agreed. We should do 2 kickers as well,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:06:31,14344222842,Luke Wray,"Fuck it, let's do defensive players",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:06:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We can def do all those things,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I hope we’re only doing IR if you drafted that player,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And No to Turnover on Downs getting 2 points???,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That makes no sense to me,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:08:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It is more difficult and usually better for your team than an INT,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:12:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My feeling on 2 defenses is, currently it's an undervalued position.  It's cheap, it's low priority",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:12:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"If everyone has 2, the pool of valuable defenses becomes more relevant",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:13:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,I would do one defensive player over two defenses,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:13:13,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Which is more analogous to the value of the defense in real football,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:14:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah I agree with Dunc. I’m down to do players over team, but it would have to be 2 players.",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:14:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Dunc or Dave,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:19:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think you meant Dave,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:20:57,84986222184,David Casstevens,My own fucking blood,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:21:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Unbelievable,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:21:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha no I meant Dunc about the value of defenses.,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:24:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, I’m down to do players over teams but we would run into the value problem again if we only do 1",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:26:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Also me right now come on guys 2018_07_10_222639_3AC4E20A422F749FC287.jpeg,image,2018_07_10_222639_3AC4E20A422F749FC287.jpeg,,,
,7/10/2018,22:27:39,14344222842,Luke Wray,I was actually kidding about doing defensive players guys,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:27:58,14344222842,Luke Wray,Like I was trying to be sarcastic,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:28:07,14344222842,Luke Wray,#fail,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:29:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,HH,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:29:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Haha,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:30:17,14344222842,Luke Wray,Something has to be said to keeping the league simple and fun,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:30:49,14344222842,Luke Wray,Like I feel we took a good board game and made it risk,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:35:22,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I don't think it will be very different from last year.  Except now defenses will go earlier in the draft, which I think is cool",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:37:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I don’t like how you can always stream defenses,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:53:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But we might need a roster spot...,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:54:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"The roster spots are already fixed, why is everyone trippin",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:56:08,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Do we still want to keep 6 bench spots, or drop one of those now that we’re adding a extra defense and IR spot",,,,,
7/11/2018,7/11/2018,0:28:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I vote keep 6 bench spots,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:37:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah keep 6,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:37:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But now streaming defenses will be less of a thing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:38:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which means that you’ll want to keep 3 defenses for bye weeks/matchups,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:38:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’ll lose a roster spot to a defense theoretically,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:42:32,14344222842,Luke Wray,That's why I say another roster spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:43:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I wouldn’t be against, depending on how the IR spot works",,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:44:40,14344222842,Luke Wray,Let's be honest the ir spot was created out of sympathy for ben lmao,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:45:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Haha,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Hahaha Luke,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ben is gonna need more than one IR spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:49,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,#BIIP,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:01,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Ben's Island of Injured Players,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:30,18048190003,Krista Gunter,That should be a shirt with his IR players faces on it,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:24:37,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Just a wasteland of torn ligaments, broken bones, and lacerated kidneys.",,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:48:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m with Luke here guys,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:04,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The one that will change things the most is the 6 point ts throwing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That’s a baaaaaad change IMO,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rodgers is now the #1 pick,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Then Brady,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:50:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Screws up the whole auction now,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:50:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Just my opinion,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:51:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Who’s the two most valuable players in real football?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:51:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Rodgers and Brady,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:54:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What do you think about defenses Scotty?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:55:38,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Will make defenses less valuable imo,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:55:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It dilutes a high week scoring,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:57:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I really don’t like how we are wording rule changes without truly explaining them out,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:57:21,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Like this IR spot or extra def,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:58:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Like the rule wasn’t to add an extra spot AND an extra def,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:08:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Scott if you had a problem with the wording you should have said something before I made the survey,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:08:56,18048190003,Krista Gunter,All of this could have been discussed in the thread before I sent it out,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:09:29,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Also why can’t we add both? If yahoo allows it then why not,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:10:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc that’s not what we voted on,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:10:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,We voted on adding a def...fine we add one,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But don’t change what we voted on by adding another spot too,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,If that’s what people wanted then the wording should have been “add a second def AND a roster spot”,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I didn’t want any of it that’s why I said nothing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:12:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"If You really wanted both, then that’s what your wording should have been",,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:11,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ok fuck me then,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Sorry guys...I’m just salty,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Hate rule changes every year,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:14:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m like 1 rule change away from jumping ship,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:14:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah we haven’t voted on an extra spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:16:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"And like if it’s 5/5, there’s no “revote”...it didn’t pass...you can’t just revote over and over to get what u guys want",,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:16:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Agree Scott - 5/5 is no pass,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Respect,,,Agree Scott - 5/5 is no pass,7/11/2018,11:16:59
,7/11/2018,11:18:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I spend one dinner with pat and he’s got my back again,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Even though you KNOW I was trying to increase that buy in!,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,If that passed I woulda voted for a buy in of $100.01,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No Scotty you’re right on all your points - can’t change wording after we voted and the rule is majority to pass,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:21:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott the throwing TD worth 6 is to make running QBs not comparatively too strong,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,True but not really...like cam newton had only what 8 running tds last year?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:07,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So +16 value,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The value is in the running yards for running qbs,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:59,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But I hear what ur saying,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m just saying it throws the draft picks off like whoa,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But people just need to adjust I guess,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rodgers and Brady are by farrrr the #1/2 picks now,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:54,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Not even close,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:02:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah we need to vote on an extra roster spot and I guess we also need to vote on if IR can only be used on drafted players or any players.,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:04:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"The wording has been good so far, we just have a couple more things to vote on",,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:28:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Wrt the drafting....be clear on if YOU have to draft or if you acquire a drafted player through a trade,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:46:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Can we change the yards needed for a point just for QBs?  If so, I’d like to propose an increase",,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:46:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,To 10 at least,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:47:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or 12,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:50:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Rush yards needed for a point that is,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:34:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also I’d like to vote on increasing the running yards needed for a point for QBs to 10 or 12,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:34:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Especially if we can offer that as an alternative to 6 point TDS for QBs,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:35:16,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think it should be only top 50. People would keep trying it so much towards the end of the draft,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:35:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What do you mean,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:36:25,12026045322,Ben Deane,That makes perfect sense,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:39:56,12026045322,Ben Deane,"If we allowed it towards the end of the draft (after the first 50 players) people would keep trying to use the rule which would further extend the draft in a boring way hence I believe that would should only allow it for the first 50 players. This would help to reduce the length of the draft, however, to Mark’s point the draft is a very enjoyable experience so I would be ok with either change.",,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:40:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yes that makes sense thanks,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:40:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Except what we were talking about was allowing nominations only AFTER the first 50,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:40:53,12026045322,Ben Deane,Wowowow,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:40:56,12026045322,Ben Deane,Missed that,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So maybe that’s why it was confusing,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:02,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think that would suck,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,Cause people would be trying to get players for 2 because they had money left,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Mark’s idea of 10 seconds per nomination is a great one,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You basically have to have a nom lined up or you missed your chance,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:54,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I hate the nomination idea,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah there has to be a time limit on nominations,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:42:00,12026045322,Ben Deane,Even tho I tilt like crazy so would for sure try to buy players for way too much,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:42:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,We’ve already been doing nominations at the end of drafts for years,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But it’s been after the top 100,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah after first 100,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Exactly,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Noms are super fun,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:44:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I do think that allowing it right at the beginning before the market is set and everyone has full stacks increases the skill gap,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:44:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So would shoot for after top 30-50,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:45:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It might speed up the draft because people can pick out their boys then go to bed,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:52:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Sure,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:53:30,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Or we can use a random generator on google,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:53:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Or we could do previous year 7th,,,,,

,7/30/2018,18:33:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We definitely need to understand how the ir spot will function.  Need to make sure it's playing nice with the additional roster spot via 2nd defense,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:33:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Changing from 100 to 75 doesn't seem like a big enough change,,,,,

,7/30/2018,18:44:18,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That would be keeping the number of bench spots the same as current,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:44:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"So, could be difficult.  Then again, maybe too generous to give 7 bench spots AND an IR spot",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:57:19,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Based on the first vote, we would just be adding the IR spot and 2nd defense to the roster",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:57:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Not changing the bench spots,,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:00:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Right.  But i think it could be a mistake for us to consider rule changes individually, and not consider the collective impact of multiple rule changes",,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:04:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I agree,,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:15:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So I think it's more like an emergency bench spot as opposed to half a bench spot,,,,,

,7/30/2018,22:23:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It will definitely decrease bench spots - people will for sure want to hold 3 defenses,,,,,

,7/30/2018,22:24:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Adding a defense I think decreases bench space by about .75,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:25:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think 3/4 of the time people in the league will want a third defense,,,,,

,7/31/2018,7:38:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"You will be able to stream a lot less when there are only, at best, 16 defenses available",,,,,
,7/31/2018,7:39:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Same thing happened with QBs when we added the second,,,,,
,7/31/2018,8:34:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think i was the only one streaming last season so I was able to do it pretty well. Took advantage of the waiver wire deadline.  But yeah the pool of defenses will be very diminished this year by comparison,,,,,
,7/31/2018,8:39:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I don’t think I’ve ever held 2 defenses at a time, unless I was approaching a bye week",,,,,

8/2/2018,8/2/2018,10:37:32,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Guys, I’m trying to put together our follow up survey for clarification on some of the proposals we voted on as well a couple new topics, but for the 2 proposals that ended in ties initially (raising the buy-in and turnover on downs changing to 2 points), are these something we are re-voting on after discussion, or leaving for next season?",,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:38:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m also not sure if we are revisiting the vote on QB throwing TD to 6 points since there was a large majority yes vote on that.,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:39:34,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I feel like the buy-in should at least stay consistent with the rate of inflation.,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:41:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Happy to revote if people are feeling it,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:41:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I need more championship $$$ so I can pay my bills bruh,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:42:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahaha Ben when happened to your staunch position on absolutely no re-votes???,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:42:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What* happened,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:42:51,12026045322,Ben Deane,"I mean, I’m trying to raise them at buyin!",,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:43:02,12026045322,Ben Deane,And also only on the ones we tied,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:43:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Agreed.,,,,,
,8/2/2018,11:56:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we should include all the questions we voted on + the new proposals and we vote/revote on everything,,,,,
,8/2/2018,11:56:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"And after this vote, it’s final and tie means it didn’t pass",,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:02:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,New proposals are in-draft trades and nominations after Top 50?,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:07:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:11:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And changing running yards needed for a point for QBs to 12,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:11:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,(Up from 8),,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:12:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And we’re not proposing an additional bench spot?,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:13:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I’m wording the IR spot as either replacing a bench spot or just adding it to the current roster, leaving the 6 bench spots open",,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:14:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think Pat’s proposing an IR spot and 7 bench spots,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:15:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I think the 2 proposals are 1. IR yes/no,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:15:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2. Additional bench spot (7 bench spots) yes/no,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:16:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I’m not really championing the extra bench spot - I think I’m leaning no there,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:17:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I thought others were in,,,,,
,8/2/2018,12:25:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m a no vote fosho,,,,,

,8/2/2018,16:58:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Maybe 70 is better,,,,,
,8/2/2018,16:59:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ok I will leave that one as a multiple choice or open ended,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:00:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What is argument for changing qb running yards points?,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:01:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Makes running quarterbacks less valuable than pocket quarterbacks,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:05:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat wants to keep passing TDs at 4 points and changing rushing yards for QBs,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:05:59,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Devalues running QBs without increasing value to pocket quarterbacks,,,,,

,8/2/2018,17:07:12,14344222842,Luke Wray,To make things infinitely more complicated in the small.hope to make it better,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:08:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Well complicated makes things interesting,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:08:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I also play in other leagues that are much more standard and they are a lot more boring,,,,,

,8/2/2018,23:35:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yes,,,,,
,8/2/2018,23:36:05,84986222184,David Casstevens,It's easy and fair,,,,,
8/3/2018,8/3/2018,7:18:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My problem with that is that the super flex will always and only be a QB,,,,,
,8/3/2018,7:19:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,They’ll score higher and you won’t ever put an RB or WR in that slot,,,,,
,8/3/2018,10:12:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Regarding nominations, I think it just feels early to me at 50.  Everyone has an average of 5 players at that point.  Draft is already a very hectic environment and this introduces some more unpredictability",,,,,
,8/3/2018,10:12:59,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Then again, that does make it more skill, and potentially more fun.",,,,,
,8/3/2018,10:13:24,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I prefer to take a baby step in that direction rather than make the leap to 50,,,,,

,8/7/2018,17:45:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also remember to bring ur money or send ur money prior to the draft,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we go with 125,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:06,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"You don’t pay, you don’t draft",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m guessing everyone who voted not to change will always vote lowest,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:47:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So 125 seems appropriate,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:47:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott I will give you $25 if you stop being a homo on the chat,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:58:26,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is there a option for like $115?  How much inflation are we talking  about per year since we started $100?  When we went from 8-10 ppl? So like 5 years?,,,,,

,8/7/2018,17:59:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah I mean I think we go with a round number like 125, as it will probably stay for at least a couple years",,,,,
,8/7/2018,18:01:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"For the record I don't want to be one of those leagues that have huge buy in, ever.  Just seems like it should be higher since we're adults now.  Inflation is convenient rhetoric",,,,,
,8/7/2018,18:01:54,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"If we’re doing like $5 increases every year, then $125 to catch up for the last 5 years sounds fair",,,,,

,8/11/2018,23:32:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I know we don’t operate in a vacuum but since nobody did better than me last year (agreed, right?) I should at least most up relatively to others",,,,,

,8/11/2018,23:32:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So please check why this didn’t happen,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:32:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Fuck em up,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:32:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And amend the ranking system accordingly,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:32:54,15408158419,Scott Gunter,🐔,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:33:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also draft efficiency shouldn’t count towards rankings,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:38:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s one part of being a good fantasy player and success in drafting is included in the other metrics,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:38:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If we include draft efficiency we should also include trade efficiency and free agent efficiency,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:39:01,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Best metric is and should only be points per season,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:39:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Boom,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:39:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Or actually $$$$,,,,,

,8/11/2018,23:55:53,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Can talk more tomorrow,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc you check the math bro,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Did you do any testing before you released?,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:18,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I did of course,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Don’t you agree that I should have improved me score from last year?,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I did the best,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:56:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yet I lost 0.71,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:57:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Not necessarily, I scored about 1 standard deviation higher than you",,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:57:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That is the main thing,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:57:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Right that’s what I’m saying,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:57:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I did better than everyone, including you last season",,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:57:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So I should at least see a positive impact,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"And if I don’t, it means the system is broke",,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m not saying move up the rankings,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But you didn't do the best necessarily,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But at least a + composite score,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Objectively I did the best,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,It depends on how we are weighting the metrics,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:59:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Also, you already had a high score from last year.  It's hard to improve upon a good score",,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:59:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,You went down in some other categories,,,,,
8/12/2018,8/12/2018,0:00:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s what I’m saying... testing the system to weight the metrics means taking things that are true (me doing the best last season) and comparing against outcomes of the system,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:00:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You had a better score than me last season but had no problem getting more so that argument doesn’t hold,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:00:59,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I am hesitant to alter the weights after using the same weights two years in a row, but it's possible to play around with those",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:01:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dude you’re not addressing my main point,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:01:18,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"The main thing is the points, which I feel is the most indicative thing for fantasy success",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:02:23,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Something I'm toying with though is weighting more recent seasons more than old seasons,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:02:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Because people will be weighed down by the past, plus no one can remember.  Still that is dangerous because it defeats the purpose to an extent",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:03:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Do you agree with my main point?,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:03:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"You think regular season champ, most wins and league winner should lose composite points?",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Regular season champ isnt considered, but avg win ratio is",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Omg you’re missing my point,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:44,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"No I've got you pat, I understand",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Stop telling me about how the system is built,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:05:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And answer my question on whether you think the a system that leads to that outcome is designed correctly,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:06:08,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"That you lost points from a successful season is probably indicative that the weights need to be changed, yes",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:06:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Agreed :),,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:07:40,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But if you look at the math, it will make more sense.  The graph which shows you losing points is shocking but doesn't show the full picture.  That's why I tried to be transparent",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:08:10,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There's also value in consistency with the weights, having been doing this for 3 years now and not changing them",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:08:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But ill take a look at it,,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:18:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Still going to take a look at the weights but wanted to mention that,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Makes sense,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You see my argument on draft efficiency?,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Cool thing to track but shouldn’t be part of composite score,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:22:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'm in favor of keeping it in some capacity because it adds texture,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:23:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"It's true that if you draft well then probably you will score many points, will do well in the season, so there is overlap",,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:26:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Have to see if Yahoo still retains that data, and for how many seasons",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:26:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t think either should be included,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:27:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t see a good argument for including,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:27:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Adding texture isn’t valid,,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:28:28,12406785346,Duncan Bell,And the players you add during the season is one of the main ways you manage your team's success,,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:29:34,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But it's not very much fun to take the average of that and call it a day,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:29:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t think it is,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:30:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Points for is a forward metric, you could make a case for the only thing that matters is money made",,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:31:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I was the better fantasy player even though you scored more points,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Because all your points came in the first half of the season,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,True but by averaging all seasons ever that would average out,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Anyway that's true and why we consider things like top 3 finish and rank,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Exactly,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Money is the same as top 3 finish,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Valid reasons for including those stats,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which is why they’re in there,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:33:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So +1 to point I was making,,,,,

,8/12/2018,8:37:48,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think my idea on looking at the end year roster is a pretty good approach for capturing data on those mid season pickups,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:37:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'll need to check the viability,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:39:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But the other thing about the draft draft metric that you didn't mention, and I think is important, is that you score well if you are efficient with draft dollars.

,8/13/2018,19:12:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,@12406785346 still listening but wanted to address something:  I don’t think we should have any player metrics because end of year points is not a good representation of how good that player was for you this season,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:15:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Example:  zeke last year.  Finished as an RB2... but that’s only because he was suspended for 6 games.  He was an RB1 for every game he played except for 1.  So should Mark get penalized for that?  Absolutely not - Zeke was a beast when he played and didn’t hurt you when he didn’t because you didn’t start him.  Much better than someone like Frank Gore who got some points every week and finished as an RB2 but you didn’t want to start him ever,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:15:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So anytime anyone gets hurts or suspended it fucks their year-end numbers and that then doesn’t accurately represent the value of that player,,,,,

,8/13/2018,20:51:54,12406785346,Duncan Bell,This does a better job than the current of weighting the top 3 players than the current,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:53:20,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But it's missing some dimensions.  For one it doesn't do as good of a job differentiating 7th-10th.  Also I do think efficiency of draft dollars is a good opportunity to add dimension,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:54:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I am also pretty strongly opposed to considering money like this.  I'm definitely in favor of weighting 1st-3rd more heavily, and I'm even thinking that we could use the current payouts to inform these relative weights",,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:54:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But I'm very opposed to valuing 7th place finish,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:55:52,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I also don't think it's a good thing to introduce volatility.  These are intended to assess the career work of a fantasy owner.  First place finishers are already getting their just desserts for having won their season,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:57:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think win ratio should be included, we may as well as it's such a fundamental aspect of fantasy",,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:57:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think your weights are a little top heavy,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:58:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I do want to incorporate playoff wins somehow, thinking about the best way to do that",,,,,
,8/13/2018,21:00:46,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think all of this should be on a separate thread,,,,,
8/14/2018,8/14/2018,8:39:14,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Some interesting things to note: the data I use to calculate points and wins are both based on end of REGULAR season stats.  Neither considers what happens in the playoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:40:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My latest thinking is, we replace avg rank with weighted avg rank, give this a larger weight, maybe 20, and also have a metric which tracks wins of any sort following the end of regular season",,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:40:13,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Even 7th and 9th place,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:47:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,And I'm also leaning towards not giving credit to byes as a playoff win,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:47:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Point of this metric would be clutch wins when it counts,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:51:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc wouldn’t money won/loss be a good metric since it can change so much?,,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:07:36,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Money is a pretty good proxy for relative weight of finishing at the top of the league, but I prefer to weight finishes in a more controlled way",,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:08:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,For one thing the fact that buy ins change is an unnecessary and unimportant complication,,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:08:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I also don't think introducing a metric which would make the ranks change a lot each year would be a good thing,,,,,
,8/14/2018,18:05:18,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Hahahahaha SKRIMPS!!!! 2018_08_14_180518_5EB8899A9D1EF6C0B042.jpeg,image,2018_08_14_180518_5EB8899A9D1EF6C0B042.jpeg,,,

,8/15/2018,16:48:44,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Fun fact: the draft is 10 days away,,,,,
,8/15/2018,16:50:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Fun!,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:00:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Fun!,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:01:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Looking at that list,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:02:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Very interesting,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:02:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,They usually update it one more time before our draft,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:02:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:03:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But it shouldn’t change a ton,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:03:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Need to get some defenses in the top 10,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:03:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s for sure,,,,,
,8/15/2018,17:22:28,12026045322,Ben Deane,I am most definitely going on tilt in this years draft,,,,,
,8/15/2018,20:53:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is everyone down for $110 for the buy-in? KJ/Luke?  I can just send the vote for the nomination amount if we’re cool with the buy-in.,,,,,
,8/15/2018,21:31:17,14344222842,Luke Wray,Its whatev,,,,,
8/16/2018,8/16/2018,9:25:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Ben and Beads, Kate and Jess are more than welcome to come down with you for the draft if they want.",,,,,
,8/16/2018,9:25:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Mimosas and biscuits and sausage gravy are on the menu for the morning.,,,,,
,8/16/2018,11:11:19,12026045322,Ben Deane,Nice thanks Krista. We still need to figure out what we’re doing we’re away 2/3 weekends and we need to buy a car,,,,,
,8/16/2018,11:13:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I’m pumped about the morning menu, Gunters. Except I’m guessing you meant Manmosas and got autocorrected.",,,,,
,8/16/2018,11:33:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,There will be both manmosas and mimosas,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:46:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think Scotty adds the most value to the group,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:47:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Then me, then Pat",,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:51:34,14344222842,Luke Wray,"Dont worry mark, Dunc will provide with a spreadsheet stating otherwise",,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:52:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Luke is also second tier and gaining,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:52:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Dave before Vietnam was top tier, but Vietnam Dave has become unstartable.",,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:53:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So KJ is in the last tier by himself?,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:53:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,With Bry,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:53:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Bry and KJ both need to get their asses in gear on the chat,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,How are you measuring value to the group?,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Luke was with them, but has been adding a lot recently.",,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Pre-Vietnam Dave was in a god tier by himself,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:12,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What are the metrics,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Nobody added more value than Dave pre Vietnam,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:39,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We might need a composite group value score,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Statboy Dunc on the case,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:54:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I disagree with rankings, but not enormously",,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:58:12,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"You know, there actually is a way to measure this",,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:58:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Now Kris has you beat,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:58:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahaha at Beads,,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:58:39,12026045322,Ben Deane,I feel like you should lose point for all voice messages over 1 min,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:58:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"There isn’t Dunc, because quantity does not equal value",,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:58:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's true,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:59:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Could get a word count, or character count",,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:59:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah absolutely,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:59:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Most of it is just shitting on me,,,,,
,8/16/2018,12:59:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But it’s good stuff,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:00:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I would be 1 but I’m not as consistent,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:00:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Both of our #1s aren’t even joining this convo so we might need to re-evaluate,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:00:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Even Vietnam Dave said something,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but did Vietnam Dave really add value?,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Pre Vietnam Dave would have started a fight over this,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That would have been value,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I mean, that’s why he’s a cellar dweller in my rankings",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Vietnam Dave made a fairly meaningless contribution,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:02:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s not worse than Bryan,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:02:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Oh god no,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:02:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But that goes without saying,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:02:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This chat would be the exact same with or without Bry,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:02:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,At least KJ has a kid every other year that he announces on here,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:03:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahaha alright Pat. With that one you’ve just solidified top tier over Kris,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:04:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,She is gaining though.,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:04:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also I think the tiers should have to be 3 people, 3 people, 4 people.",,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:06:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think the metric should be:,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:06:29,14344222842,Luke Wray,"Pat you would be top tier, but only needledicks aren't allowed",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:06:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"If you could still run for president if the press got ahold of this chat, you’re not top tier",,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:09:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Which are the best in my metrics, btw.",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:09:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Pre Vietnam Dave would go immediately to jail if the press got ahold of this,,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:09:47,14344222842,Luke Wray,"Since we are using top tier, might as well use smash characters",,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:11:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Mark could,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:11:06,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I feel like you don't usually say fucked up shut,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:11:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What? Dude I’ve said some super inappropriate shit on here,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:11:12,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But you laugh at fucked up shit,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:11:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s why he’s not at he top - he never says anything controversial,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:12:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Only really about gay jokes and having sex with underage girls,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:12:26,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Hahaha,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:12:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But still a few fucked up things,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:13:16,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What do you guys think about a metric which is something to the effect of: causing or active participation in a conversation,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:13:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But Pat doesn’t even say the underage girl stuff as a joke, so he’s def top tier",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:15:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I like it Dunc, but causing should definitely be weighted more than active",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:19:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha Luke are you regretting making the joke that Dunc could make make a spreadsheet about this?,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:20:13,14344222842,Luke Wray,Haha yep,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:21:13,14344222842,Luke Wray,"No way to do it accurately. Everyone perceives things differently so even if he did it, it might mean more to him/less to someone else",,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:32:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s a good point. And I’m perceiving Scott’s silence as a value decrease.,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:32:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"So, like Dunc did with the composite rankings, I’m afraid I’m going to have to rank myself #1",,,,,

,8/21/2018,11:55:27,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"We had 1 vote to stay at 100, but that person revoted between the two majority options",,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:55:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Without knowing the tally,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:56:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"So the original votes were 5, 4, and 1?",,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:56:42,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:57:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Seems to me like we should go with the original majority then,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:57:53,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I don’t think 5 is majority,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:59:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Agree with kris,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:59:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also 50 is wayyy to low guys...bigger teams this year AND nominations that low...wow,,,,,

,8/21/2018,12:07:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahahaha,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:24:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Technically 5 is the plurality here,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,5 is not the majority,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t pass,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This is different because we’re deciding between 2 alternatives,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My feeling is that we either need someone to change their vote or go with a compromise like 60,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,5 is the majority when compared with 4 and 1,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s not,,,,,

,8/21/2018,12:28:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That would be considered no change...so 100 is an invalid response,,,,,

,9/11/2018,12:15:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,12 out of the top 50 fantasy scorers from any position are defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:15:44,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Haha for the people who spent $1 on defenses, yes.",,,,,

,9/11/2018,12:18:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Yeah I mean you have OBJ hitting his projected and 12 def score more than him,,,,,

,9/11/2018,12:20:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Honestly I’m okay with that. If Jags defense is amazing and wins the game for their team, they should score a lot of points.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:21:02,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then OBJ doesn’t score and his team loses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:25:04,12026152479,Bryan Lee,but it's all of the defenses popping off,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:25:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like what would you say the avg DEF 1 position should be equivalent to? like a WR2? or WR3?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:26:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,WR1,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:27:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Meaning top 10 receiver, but obviously depending on the year",,,,,

,9/11/2018,12:49:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Did we change the scoring for defenses as we agreed?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:49:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,.5 for punts instead of 1 point for 3 and out?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:51:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I mean some of these defenses definitely won the game for their team,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Both their NFL team and their Fantasy team,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Just checked, I don’t think we’ve done this",,,Did we change the scoring for defenses as we agreed?,9/11/2018,12:49:08
,9/11/2018,12:52:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scotty can you check?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Krista did the changes,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:53:15,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I got pissed and lost privileges,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:53:23,15408158419,Scott Gunter,😬,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:55:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I checked the defense scoring and we can’t change anything for punts unless it’s yards for returns,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:55:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s not an option,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:01:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,.5 for punts will give defenses more points than 1 for 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:01:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So defense scoring would have been even higher this week,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:07:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I am out right now, but will double check the scoring when I get home",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:50:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Regardless Marky, that’s what we agreed",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:53:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We agreed on something that someone didn’t double check to make sure it was a changeable rule,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:55:54,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Also we voted yes on turnover on downs to 2 points, isn’t that just a 3 and out anyway?",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:56:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s a different thing,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:56:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"If we can’t change it, we can’t change it, but we should check if we can",,,,,

,9/11/2018,14:55:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We absolutely should change if we can,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:56:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Whether it changes retrospectively or not,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:56:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Hmm,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:57:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also if we can’t change I would argue to get rid of points for 3 and out anyway since that was part of the thing we voted on,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:57:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Most of the reason I proposed that rule was because points for 3 and out is dumb,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:02:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,3 and outs are big for field position and momentum.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:03:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And they’re not very common,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:03:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Except for the top defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:05:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Which is why I like it, it clearly separates great defenses from the average ones",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:06:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A defensive TD can be fluky. Six 3 and outs is just a dominant defensive performance,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:21:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Alright, we can’t change the half point scoring for punting.  Only thing we can do for punts is change return yards or kickoff/punt return TDs.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:22:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Balls,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:22:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we get rid of points for 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:23:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or reduce to .5,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:23:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Part of the thing we voted on was “instead of points for 3 and outs, .5 points for punts”",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:24:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We actually can’t do too many changes on defense in Yahoo cause there aren’t a lot of options to go on.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:24:58,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Well the question was “change defensive scoring to be 0.5 for every punt, as opposed to 1 point for a 3 and out”",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:25:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Not “instead of”,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:26:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,We cannot take away both,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:26:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That significantly devalues defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:27:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,My team would have had 10 less points last week without 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,“As opposed to” and “instead of” are exact same thing,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think you’re right Mark,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dammit,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We should have checked on this before the draft,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:44:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I don’t know what to say about this.  I made all the changes we voted on, except the punt vote which isn’t an option in Yahoo.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:57:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think there would be a huge difference anyway,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:27:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we just roll with it as is,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:29:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Agreed,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:30:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But Pat, to get back to the original convo",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:31:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,You don’t care that Bry is salty about defenses going off last week?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:34:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i just think defenses are over-weighted now, especially since there is the most limited selection of defenses out of all positions - so there will be very little turnover of defenses",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:34:56,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"there's no backup defense or anything, just one per team",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"of course it's too early to tell, but if the week 1 trend holds, defenses will prob be going off the boards at ~$35+ next auction based on their value and scarcity",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No I don’t care that Bry is salty,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The thing with defenses is that 1. It’s hard to predict who will be great defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:22,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so that makes it even more luck-based right?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I suspect defenses will be more volatile than other positions which could be the difference maker,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We cannot know that after week 1,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2. When it’s all said and done the difference between the defenses is not that big,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:38:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,3. This was a crazy week,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:42:43,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Oh!!!! All y’all salty about rule changes?!?!?!,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What did we actually change?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:10,18048190003,Krista Gunter,This league is so ass backwards sometimes I swear.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahha,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:46,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"You voted for 2 defenses, but then are salty about the extra weights we voted on for them.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Added a point for 4th down turnover,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, 14 of the top 50 scoring players in week 1 were defenses",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So it’s not our league,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It was this week,,,,,

,9/11/2018,18:39:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The original question was did our rule changes wildly inflate defensive scoring or was it a crazy week for defense?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,18:39:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,By comparing to a standard league it’s obvious that it was a crazy week for defense in fantasy football,,,,,

,9/11/2018,18:41:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Comparing to same week different rules doesn't necessarily prove that,,,,,
,9/11/2018,18:42:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,here are the average scores for week 1 for some of the positions: \n\nDEF 1: 23.1 \nDEF 2: 15.8 \n\nRB 1: 28.2 \nRB 2: 17.5\n\nWR 1: 29.5 \nWR 2: 18.3\n\nQB 1: 26.8 \nQB 2: 14.9,,,,,
,9/11/2018,18:42:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But comparing to our old rules, at least we prove that we had no agency",,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:38:06,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think we set the rule that you can only use an ir spot for a drafted player.  Is that right?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:38:14,84986222184,David Casstevens,yes Mark got us both on mixon,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:39:20,12406785346,Duncan Bell,How DO you put a player in IR spot?  I don't see an option,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:39:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,yea I didn't see anything,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:40:58,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Oh, yeah.  So Yahoo must make the option available only if player is actually ir",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:41:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,so strange,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:42:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’d love an IR that we can put people on and those players can’t be used for 4 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:42:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But at least this covers those special cases so owners like Krista last year don't get fucked all season,,,Yeah that’s why it’s fucking stupid,9/12/2018,11:39:17
,9/12/2018,11:42:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Even if they’re playing,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:42:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4 weeks is too short,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:42:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s just an extra roster spot,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:42:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It would have to be 6,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:42:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Not really,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:43:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,6 would be cool,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:43:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I mean 4 also cool, but obviously more generous",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:43:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4 and not a drafted player?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:43:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Extra bench spot,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:44:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Makes it easy to stash players that you think will be good later in season,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:44:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Exactly,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:44:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,For example Mike Williams for me right now,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:45:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I also don’t understand why Pat said he’s feeling a bench crunch right now?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:45:33,84986222184,David Casstevens,mike will?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:45:36,84986222184,David Casstevens,he's hurt,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:46:06,84986222184,David Casstevens,not about rules already established,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:46:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahahaha,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:46:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I was disappointed I didn't get amari Cooper but maybe that was a big play,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:47:01,84986222184,David Casstevens,I just bid on all the players Mark and pat wanted,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:48:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m looking at the draft sheet now and I don’t really see anyone that went under value,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:48:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Ok so a couple of things about the IR spot, since I had to look through the help section in Yahoo",,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:49:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’d like to stash an extra QB and DEF but can’t afford either right now,,,And I also don’t understand why Pat said he’s feeling a bench crunch right now?,9/12/2018,11:45:11
,9/12/2018,11:50:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,James Conner?,,,I’m looking at the draft sheet now and I don’t really see anyone that went under value,9/12/2018,11:48:14

,9/12/2018,11:51:01,84986222184,David Casstevens,startable,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:51:06,84986222184,David Casstevens,not shareable,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:54:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,wait so all a player has to be is out and you drafted him,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:54:26,84986222184,David Casstevens,what if he only out 2 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:54:28,84986222184,David Casstevens,?,,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:55:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,IT HAS TO BE A PLAYER YOU ORIGINALLY DRAFTED,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:55:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,interesting,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,is everyone okay with this,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,need a vote,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m fine with it since he hasn’t been picked up already,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"So, suppose you have a player who is \""Out\"", and is only out for 2 weeks.  You placed him on IR spot.  When do you get to take him out of IR?",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"When we voted on it, it was with the stipulation than the player had to be designated as IR",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah it’s valid,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:20,84986222184,David Casstevens,we need everyone to vote,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"@Mark, yes since I assumed that was the only option Yahoo allowed the spot to be used for",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:47,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I won't use him for 6 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"But after looking through the help section, you can use it for a player being out or PUP",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But there isn't any restriction to being able to take a player out of your IR spot once placed, right?",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:47,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Like, you could do it any time from Yahoo's perspective",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I think if its a player you draft if he gets a multiweek injury you can put him there but can't use him for 6 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,it's a way to hold on to your studs without sacrificing your season,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:32,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We could institute our own rule that it has to be at least 6 Weeks before you can use that player again,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:35,84986222184,David Casstevens,wasn't that the point,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:44,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So the NFL IR is for 8 games (half the regular season). Which is why I originally proposed 6 games (half our regular season),,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:00:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think ir is 6 weeks mark,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:00:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,almost positive,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:01:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Dunc lemme voice message this one,,,"But there isn't any restriction to being able to take a player out of your IR spot once placed, right?",9/12/2018,11:58:35

,9/12/2018,13:09:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Basically, I'm down for Yahoo's rules since that is what I thought we were going with, but I don't fully understand their settings. It sounds like once the player moves out of one of the eligible designations, you cannot make any roster moves until you activate that player and make a space for them.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:09:47,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Correct,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:12,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I just want to find common ground on the spirit of the rule and the letter,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:13,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Obviously, I am biased with the Bell situation, but if he holds out until week 8-9, that would kinda suck.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Which makes sense, after they are eligible to start IR becomes an extra bench spot",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Isn’t my deal with dez the same issue kJ?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,well it would suck more If you put him in ir and he plays next week. you won't be able to release him for 5 more weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"I guess my question is hypothetically, if I picked up Olsen off waivers, could I stash him on IR. I don't think you should be able to do that.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:52,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We had said that IR spot was only available for players you drafted,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think it should be because of injury,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:06,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"I believe Dez is NA, which is not eligible.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,right,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:14:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But what I’m saying is he is holding out for $$$....sesame issue,,,"I believe Dez is NA, which is not eligible.",9/12/2018,13:12:06

,9/12/2018,13:14:59,84986222184,David Casstevens,right I don't think it would be okay for bell either,,,,,

,9/12/2018,13:19:05,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Well I think that is moot anyway. Yahoo rules will not allow Dez to IR.,,,,,

,9/12/2018,15:52:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,It's hard for anyone to follow because there are so many chats,,,,,
,9/12/2018,15:53:26,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But if we're concerned about the openness of the Yahoo IR spot rules, a simple solution would be to only allow a player to be moved there if they are officially designated IR",,,,,
,9/12/2018,15:53:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's what we had in mind originally,,,,,

9/13/2018,9/13/2018,10:57:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My projections go up about 1.5 points every day...I like to think yahoo is saying “this guy may be on to something”,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:16:06,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think we need to decide on how IR spot works for the season.  To help discussion let me lay out options,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:16:33,14344222842,Luke Wray,Redraft,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:16:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Lol,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:16:50,14344222842,Luke Wray,That is only option,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:17:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Option 1: we allow IR spot to behave according to off the shelf rules, meaning it can be used for any player with Out, PUP, or IR designation",,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:18:01,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Option 2: we use Yahoo rules for IR spot but house rule that only eligible players are those who are actually designated IR,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Option 2 is what we voted for,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:22,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I feel like we have to stay with that for this year and revisit it next season,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We’re already using house rules because you can’t put any player on there,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Option 3: we have some mix of these.  For example, we could allow for \""Out\"" to be used, but they need to be due to an injury.  And/or, we use a simple list outside of Yahoo to keep track of IR spot players, so we can implement some restriction on how long a player needs to be unavailable",,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:21:20,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"For example, David declares he is using his IR spot on Greg olsen, and so he cannot pick Greg olsen back up until 6 weeks have elapsed.  And no one else can pick him up during that period.",,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:25:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think the IR spot is a fucking bologna factory,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:26:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That being said we voted on Option 2 so I think that’s what we need to roll with,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:31:01,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think option 2 is good, and also in spirit of what we voted on.  But I'm fine with any of these.",,,,,

,9/20/2018,21:38:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha yeah the line isn’t blocking and receivers are running the wrong routes. Let’s throw a rookie QB in there!!!,,,,,

,10/10/2018,18:29:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s a great question,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:36:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Def don't faab it because he already went to FA,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:38:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If multiple people want him why do we need to play fucking quick draw?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:38:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s the dumbest thing in our league,,,,,

,10/10/2018,18:38:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I also am never free during the day so it’s just retarded for me,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:39:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah someone should have bid $0 FAAB on him,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:39:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I bid $3 on him but I got clement instead,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:39:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But now I want him,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What’s the downside of putting him on waivers again?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And bidding?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And Dave can’t bid,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s the punishment,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think he’ll go straight back to FA,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not waivers,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:59,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Because Dave didn’t get him on waivers,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:43:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes he goes back to FA unless he drops his tomorrow,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:43:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Then it’s waivers I think,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:44:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"We can’t do anything with it until he drops him, which he hasn’t done yet",,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:54:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. Same day pickup from FA and drop goes back to FA. Otherwise it would be a strategy to lock everyone up in Waivers by doing that.,,,,,
,10/10/2018,19:12:28,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’ve tried to do this before,,,Yeah. Same day pickup from FA and drop goes back to FA. Otherwise it would be a strategy to lock everyone up in Waivers by doing that.,10/10/2018,18:54:21

,10/11/2018,21:18:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s not the same as an interception and we all know it,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah that makes defense less of a crapshoot,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:19:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A punt on avg changes field position 43 yards,,,,,

,10/15/2018,23:02:15,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,He already got one. Sucks cause GB didn't convert on 4th down and left SF to start their drive at the one.,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:03:31,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I think our D scoring is too aggressive overall this year.,,,,,

,10/26/2018,21:00:11,84986222184,David Casstevens,I promise,,,,,
,10/26/2018,21:01:08,84986222184,David Casstevens,"And then you can give me the exact hour when Scott \""supposedly\"" gives it to me in the butt",,,,,
,10/26/2018,21:55:52,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Oh it’s not supposedly,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:30:30,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm confused,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:30:53,84986222184,David Casstevens,Was your supposedly supposed to be in quotations?,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:37:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mark,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:37:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,I have to push back a bit,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:38:14,84986222184,David Casstevens,Your call on mahomes is such an easy one,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:41:26,84986222184,David Casstevens,So what your telling me he's not gunna take a run at Peytons SS touchdown record. Because his pace is just under that,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:41:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,That dosebt take a guru at fantasy pros to figure that out,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:42:59,84986222184,David Casstevens,But......... excluding injury he will be a top 5 qb rest of season,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:43:27,84986222184,David Casstevens,My question for you is what does your eye test say about him,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,My eye test tells me he’s the new Desaun Watson,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,So what does that mean,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then I looked up the stats and their first 7 NFL games are almost identical,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:46:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I brought him up because ESPN did a segment about how he was the front runner to win the MVP this year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:47:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I think his play will regress as the season goes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:48:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,As defenses get film and the weather gets worse. And they’ve also had all their weapons completely healthy so far,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:49:00,18048190003,Krista Gunter,The fuck is this?,,,My question for you is what does your eye test say about him,10/26/2018,22:43:27
,10/26/2018,22:49:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If Tyreek and Kelce miss games, this offense will look different",,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:49:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Top 5 rest of season is close,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:51:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Absolutely if anyone loses their best two receivers they wont be as good But......,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:52:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm gunna give you my scouting report since you are busy and can't divulge,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:56:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Except for the actually great QBs,,,Absolutely if anyone loses their best two receivers they wont be as good But......,10/26/2018,22:51:10
,10/26/2018,22:56:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,Here is what I will say,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:56:49,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I.e. Brady (🐐), Rodgers, Brees",,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,Since cam Newton came out,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mahomes is the best thrower of the football I have seen,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,Like a pitcher he has many different types of throws,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:51,84986222184,David Casstevens,Not just a fastball,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:58:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,And brady wasn't great his first year playing,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:59:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha Deion Branch was his top pass catcher,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,He threw for 140 yards in a Superbowl win. He threw like  one touchdown in that playoff run,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:16,84986222184,David Casstevens,He is the goat but he became great,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Rank these young QBs: Luck, Wentz, Watson, Goff, Darnold, Goff",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,Where is mahomes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:37,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Goff on there twice,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Shit I meant Mahomes instead of a second Goff,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:01:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I obviously love Goff,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:01:13,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So Mahomes is just a Goff’s dobbleganger then,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:02:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mahomes wentz luck watson Goff and I think darnold could be top three in a couple years,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:03:05,84986222184,David Casstevens,Top three of the younger classes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:05:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m gonna save this text for when mahomes is at the bottom of the QB barrel next year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:02,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yea if he gets injured,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahaha Dave always likes the shiny new toy,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:11,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Dude has played 7 games and he’s the top young QB??,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:08:03,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I’m ranking them Goff, Watson, Wentz, Mahomes, Luck, Darnold",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:08:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Maybe even Luck last because he’s been in the league 6 years already,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:09:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Well I feel like I am pretty good at breaking down talent. If you guys don't see that he has a rocket when he needs it but throws touch passes on the perimeter and can stretch the defense with the biggest arm in the league all to go with being extremely accurate in his basically rookie season......... then I don't know how we can talk about this going forward,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ok good talk,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,I agree,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Love these conversations,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:43,84986222184,David Casstevens,Everyone wins,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:11:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I didn’t realize Luck was 6 years in. He’s definitely the best in that group, but that’s really not fair with that much experience",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:12:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think I’ve ever seen a QB start his career with such little coaching and roster talent around him,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:12:38,84986222184,David Casstevens,I can agree he might be the best but I have to go off body of work in his case. I think he could be the best in the league in about three years but he has to stay healthy and they have to get an o line,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And Mahomes has great arm talent, but I’ve seen the 1st QB take the league by storm and then regress back to good or average in the second season",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,1st season* QB,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:42,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yea if they can't sit in the pocket and throw dimes!!!!,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Cam,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:50,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mariotta,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Tyrod,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:30,84986222184,David Casstevens,Bridgewatwr,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:35,84986222184,David Casstevens,Rg iii,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Kapernick,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:51,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yes I get that,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,He isn't that type of player,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:06,84986222184,David Casstevens,He is a thrower,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Cam, RG3, and Kaep are great examples",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:11,84986222184,David Casstevens,Loves to throw,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Nobody realized they couldn’t get through progressions until year 2,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:47,84986222184,David Casstevens,You think he is like those players,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Mahomes mostly throws to wide open receivers,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,Dude have you watched these games,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:55,84986222184,David Casstevens,He isn't just a rocket,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:59,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think he and Watson are both better throwers than those guys,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Agree,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I’m reserving judgement until next year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Every QB in the league right now is wishing they were playing in that offense,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Duh. That's why I drafted him. It's nice to have my son on your team,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Watkins is not a #1 option, but he’s a helluva #4 option",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,Makes you look great,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:19:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,The first game I saw my son I knew he was great. I don't need to wait a year on players if I see it,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:20:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I think if he was on the Jets or Cards, he’d be about QB20",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:21:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,20 is high but I would say around qb 10-12,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:21:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’ll take that bet that he isn’t top 5 from week 8 through fantasy playoffs,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:22:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Well one he hasn't had his bye,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:22:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,You said this minutes ago,,,But......... excluding injury he will be a top 5 qb rest of season,10/26/2018,22:42:59
,10/26/2018,23:23:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,Okay just to give him his props give me his top score of the year during his bye and you can put that shit on the board,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:23:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’ll give you his bottom score,,,,,

,11/21/2018,10:56:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The MVP conversation is officially over.,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Who should be MVP?,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Zeke, but Amari is making a pretty good case for himself",,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahaha,,,,,

,11/21/2018,10:58:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:58:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But personally I think Luck is the MVP,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"In the strictest sense of the phrase, you might be right",,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But no ones views it like that,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s more “who’s the best player on a great team”,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I wish they would change it to POY,,,,,

,11/21/2018,12:24:08,84986222184,David Casstevens,But brees is second,,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:26:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Obviously his PR agent just told him to apologize a thousand times and take responsibility for everything,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:28:46,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I’d say if she could push him into the wall and then kick him, all is forgiven.",,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:35:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Tyreek punched his pregnant girlfriend in the stomach,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:36:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Ray Rice dragged his knocked out wife down the hallway,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:37:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And the video we’re seeing is obviously edited to look as bad as it could possibly look,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:37:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What’s happening between those cuts,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:38:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s still fucked up,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:38:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s obviously a piece of shit,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:39:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Even though it’s not that bad, and if he would have done it to a man I wouldn’t think twice.  But the fact that he’s going around pushing women... he’s a piece of shit",,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:39:52,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is it though? Is that what men have to tell themselves in order to defend an abuser?,,,And the video we’re seeing is obviously edited to look as bad as it could possibly look,12/2/2018,11:37:30
,12/2/2018,11:40:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,This is not a case of abuse,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:40:30,18048190003,Krista Gunter,??,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:40:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Domestic violence includes a relationship where emotional manipulation and a power dynamic is present,,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:41:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I never said it was domestic violence, but what he did doesn’t make him less of an abuser",,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:42:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yes it does,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:42:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I’d define it as abuse, yes",,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:42:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I’d agree he’s LESS of an abuser than Tyreek or RR,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:42:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He should still get kicked off the the team and I’d be happy if he never played again,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:43:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A relationship or power dynamic has to be in place for it to be abuse,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:43:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Assault, sure",,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:43:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not abuse,,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:43:49,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It’s a huge difference,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:44:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Getting in an argument with a stranger is the Grand Canyon compared to emotionally abusing your spouse,,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:44:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What point are you trying to make though?,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:46:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"A suspension should happen, but the banished from the league stuff is a huge overreaction",,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:48:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I feel like people on TV have to say he should never play again because they’re afraid they’ll get fired if they don’t say that,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:49:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s also an example,,,,,

,12/2/2018,11:50:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s what’s bothering me the most about the whole thing,,,,,
,12/2/2018,11:52:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,As much as I think he should be dropped from the team and I’m ok if he is banned from the NFL...,,,,,

What he did was wrong for sure, but I need more context than what’s being offered.\n\nAnd that context we will never get bc people will never ask bc of the fear of being associated as a supporter.  Remember that time that Steven A said “we need context” to the Ray Rice video and was immediately suspended",,,,,
,12/2/2018,12:02:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s a great point,,,,,

,12/3/2018,11:12:59,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Yeah, I had Samuels over Ware as handcuff on my roster since he had TE eligibility and Conners had the concussion and was struggling. Doubt I'll need him in TE spot with Kelce.",,,,,
,12/3/2018,11:14:07,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,My playoff prospects looking dim. Dunc is unbeatable unless Gurley or McCaffrey cool off.,,,,,

,12/3/2018,11:22:36,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. It sucks but I am glad I made the move for Cook this year. Knew I couldn't have too much RB depth. I'm hoping Cook can give me at least 75% of Hunts production. I also need Conner to step back up. He hasnt been giving the Bell like production he was earlier.,,,,,

,1/8/2019,18:00:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,part of what makes Belichick great is that he is a pessimist and always prepares for the worst,,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:00:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"for example, the final goal line defense he ran against seattle in the SB, that stopped Seattle from winning was a defense they ran just that one time, meant specifically for that kind of situation",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:00:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"meant to look like a nickel-like defense, but was in fact a goal line defense",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:01:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"also too many NFL organizations try and cherry pick good things from other organizations and end up with a bunch of patchwork pieces that don't really fit together and the organization ends up lacking its own distinct culture and direction, which ultimately leads to a poor organization",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:02:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"patriots keep things very simple, they have an archetype of what kind of team they want to create and then focus on a culture of hard work and no ego, i.e. they have an archetype of wanting a very fast and physical team and will draft people only that fit that archetype first and foremost",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:02:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So the browns,,,"also too many NFL organizations try and cherry pick good things from other organizations and end up with a bunch of patchwork pieces that don't really fit together and the organization ends up lacking its own distinct culture and direction, which ultimately leads to a poor organization",1/8/2019,18:01:47
,1/8/2019,18:03:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, he brings up the browns specifically as a dysfunctional organization where the Coach, Owner, and GM don't trust one another and don't give each another enough room to create their own space and culture",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:04:18,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"Lombardi used to have a handful of bad teams he would watch, and if his team and one of these bad teams were both interested in the same player for the draft, he would reconsider and most likely avoid that player",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:05:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Well run NFL organizations also look a lot like well run startups or businesses,,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:05:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they would run after action reports after every win and loss, and each coach would need to submit what they did well and what they could do better",,,,,

,2/19/2019,9:46:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There are a lot of common idioms that have their roots in racism or bigotry.  Like \""jerry-rig\"", it was a term that meant have a black guy do a job ie do it quick and poorly",,,,,

,2/19/2019,9:47:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,To it depends on what you’re referring to as blackface,,,Here’s another question:  how do you feel about all these people getting fucked for racist things (ie black face) when they were young?,2/19/2019,8:56:23
,2/19/2019,9:48:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Blackface 100 years ago when a white guy would do it and dress like a court jester t specifically demean black people is definitely racist,,,,,
,2/19/2019,9:48:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think there is some distinction to be made between people dressing up as a black person for Halloween (eg Michael Jackson) and getting in blackface with someone dressed as kkk,,,,,
,2/19/2019,9:48:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But a guy putting on dark makeup in the 80s as part of a Mr. T costume is different,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:36:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But it’s very different than Muslims,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:36:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Muslims I like on a personal level, they’re usually very lovely and clam and kind",,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:36:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I don’t agree with their ideology,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:37:05,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And o imagine they’re nice to me because I’m a straight male,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:37:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If I were a woman or gay I’m not sure I’d get the same kindness,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:37:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My thing is only the 4pm Friday’s and the Saturday thing....they’re extremely sensitive about it.  I’ve had to cover teams for a Friday night on a projects that I was not on just bc the person had to leave,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:37:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And that’s unacceptable,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:42:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Any of the big three religious texts, interpreted by their letter, are unacceptable by current social standards",,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:44:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Do you think it’s fair to ask someone to cover another person bc of that,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:44:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I would be annoyed.  But I'm also an athiest,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:44:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I guess it doesn't matter,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:44:46,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yea..ur religion does t matter,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:47:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,People have freedom of religion in this country so that means people get to practice their shit,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:47:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think all you can say is...to the extent someone's religion is inhibiting others' liberties, like if it's your religion to beat your wife, that's not cool",,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:48:59,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I don't like that orthodox Jews get to take advantage of the system.  I also think we need the system,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:49:41,12406785346,Duncan Bell,The other annoying thing about orthodox Jews is that they come into a community and take over.  They vote as a block and they are numerous,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:51:01,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Explain this to me,,,The other annoying thing about orthodox Jews is that they come into a community and take over.  They vote as a block and they are numerous,2/19/2019,10:49:41
,2/19/2019,10:51:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,They organize whom they want to vote for?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:55:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah they all move somewhere,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:55:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And all arrange to vote for the same person,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:55:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Who favors their agenda,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:55:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or is an Orthodox Jew themselves,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:56:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah I think that's right, and they can move into a small town and basically become an instant majority voice or at least a plurality",,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:56:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Which is cool, but since they don’t integrate well it’s many times to the detriment of the other people who live there",,,,,

,2/19/2019,11:05:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,The word gay dosent mean homosexual to me,,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:05:58,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Like suppose honkey was originally derogatory towards blacks, but then 100 years later it is used in popular culture.  Is it still racist?  Words do change their meaning over time",,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:06:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Like think dunc is gay but not a homo,,,,,

,2/19/2019,11:07:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,The Louise ck stanup on that topic is hilarious,,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:08:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think part of the problem with outrage culture is that the public is unable to handle a nuanced truth when there is a simple, loud, commonly held interpretation available",,,,,

,2/19/2019,11:10:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,💯,,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:11:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Everyone should watch Avenue Q,,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:43:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Because we’re all puppets to the secretive power elite?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,11:44:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Because I guess the creators thought the only way to explain how everyone is racist and too PC is with puppets,,,,,

,2/19/2019,12:23:00,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I don't think so,,,,,
,2/19/2019,12:28:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No you’re good Kris,,,,,
,2/19/2019,12:28:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’ll vouch for you,,,,,
,2/19/2019,12:44:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Not yet, but who knows in 10 or 20 years",,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:50:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i'm jumping in late on the previous topics, but i think chink is fairly offensive, but i think the intent behind it matters more than just the word itself",,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:50:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,also think it's fucked up that they prevent more asians from getting into harvard,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:51:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,especially when they say their admissions are merit-based,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:51:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think if they're doing affirmative action for white people they need to come out and own it and have a program,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:52:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or come out and label themselves as a historically white college,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:55:00,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think it's ultimately bad for harvard in the long run too,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:55:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they get less qualified students, they tarnish their brand of being the best of the best, and other institutions will surpass them",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:02:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"also i think a difference with the orthodox jews and why they act so tribal is partly to do with being a minority that you can easily identify visually, like different races",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,a lot of races that are a minority will stick together especially when moving to a new place,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i.e. chinatowns,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:48,12026045322,Ben Deane,Bryan just dropping truth bombs all over the bitch,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:59,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you expect discrimination, so you try and create your own little world where there's no room for it",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:08:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah it’s different with the Orthodox Jews,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:08:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Super true,,,"they get less qualified students, they tarnish their brand of being the best of the best, and other institutions will surpass them",2/19/2019,13:55:37
,2/19/2019,14:09:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Although it’s basically affirmative action,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,One benefit of affirmative action is diversity creates a richer environment,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So according to that argument it would be a detriment to Harvard if it were all Asian,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which I agree with in principle,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:11:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But there’s so many different dimensions on which to create diversity... people focus too much on race,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:11:44,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah i agree with that too, but how much diversity is required?",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Some, you can’t have just all Asian kids from Northern California",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:09,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like if current affirmative action programs require like 4% black people, then maybe it should be 4% white people too",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:14,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or 4% minimum for all races,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Even if they’re the smartest,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i mean, i think you can",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:38,12026152479,Bryan Lee,they just don't go to harvard,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m saying Harvard can’t have that,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:13:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"but if they deem like 4% black population as \""diverse enough\"" then shouldn't that level suffice for the white population too?",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Great point,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or they should just say that they want their school population to represent the generael population of the US in diversity and make it a rule,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Right... why cap Asians at 60% or whatever,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,They would never cap white people at 60%,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,right,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Same thing with the schools in NY,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:16:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which are 62% Asian and people are throwing a fit,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:16:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I agree though... caps are dumb,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Some quotas in schools are ok,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like 20% diverse I can see a good argument for,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Not in the workplace though, it’s already too late",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah i think affirmative action has a place,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:18:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,affirmative action startiiiiiing now in 2019,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:52:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think race should be on any applications at all,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I totally understand why it was necessary immediately following segregation, but that was generations ago now",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so do you think there should be no minimum amount of diversity?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think the only affirmative action now should be on a financial basis,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Yeah but you’re only looking at it from a “equality of opportunity” perspective, which might be the most important",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:46,12026152479,Bryan Lee,segregation was just like 2 generations ago and outright racism was just one generation ago and still a part of current generations,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But there’s also another side of diversity: having a more diverse student body enriched everyone’s experience,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:55:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,*enriches,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:55:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Financial affirmative action would diversify,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:56:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’d be ok with the entire student body being female?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:56:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And it would be a more enriching experience than an upper middle class Asian, Black and White students",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:56:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If that’s what it came down to?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,100%,,,So you’d be ok with the entire student body being female?,2/19/2019,14:56:31
,2/19/2019,14:57:14,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s retarded Mark,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:22,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I try extremely hard to get into that school,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Would try*,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You’d need a lot of affirmative action,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:49,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Some type of program for retards,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:58,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i tend to agree, but there will always be inherent bias by the school administration in charge of filtering students, where I think you need an explicit policy in place to encourage actual diversity, i.e. people casting out \""black\"" sounding last names",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:26,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s the third dimension: biases,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Oh yeah, names shouldn’t be on the application either",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which I agree are a thing but also agree with Mark are probably diminishing,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think you can't just have complete equality of opportunity, like a total freemarket",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A simple number system,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:59:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Agree 100% with this,,,"Oh yeah, names shouldn’t be on the application either",2/19/2019,14:58:42
,2/19/2019,14:59:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"because free markets don't really work, just like how a business can have a monopoly, it's worse for everyone involved",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:59:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but markets should be as free as possible,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:59:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And err on the side of being too free,,,,,
,2/19/2019,15:00:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i think having all of that identifying info should be removed - i think it's also not diminishing as much as you think it is; we had a diversity hiring consultancy come in and give a talk to our company last year and the simple name change from black/white and name change from male/female made like a 10%+ difference in acceptance rate and salary",,,,,
,2/19/2019,15:06:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Well, male to female is completely understandable",,,,,

,3/15/2019,11:28:15,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And the last 5 games of last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,11:29:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So essentially 13 game suspension,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:31:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rays was much worse for 4 games,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:32:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Waaaaaaaay worse,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:32:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Wonder how bad his other incident was,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:35:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Oh there was another incident?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:43:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Something happened at a resort we stayed at over the summer in Ohio and he covered that up too,,,,,
,3/15/2019,13:54:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Why would the Steelers trade Antonio Brown to Oakland for the #66 and #142 picks in the 2019 draft? isn't that a steel? Wouldn't a current top 5 receiver be worth more than a top 5 draft of just the incoming players? let alone #66 and #142?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:00:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah everyone’s first reaction was “isn’t AB worth a lot more than that”,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:00:57,12026045322,Ben Deane,Worst trade ever was Odell,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:05,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s 5 years younger than AB,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,AB is already 30,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But obviously he’s not, the Steelers made it clear he was going to be traded and this is the nest offer they got",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Best* offer,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:02:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not to mention the freeing of cap space,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:02:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Interesting that the WRs with the biggest contracts got traded pretty quickly after the deal,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:04:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also Dez and Demaryius’ big contracts weren’t great for their teams either,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:05:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Two firsts and a third is about right,,,Worst trade ever was Odell,3/15/2019,14:00:57
,3/15/2019,14:05:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,As well as clearing cap space for a rebuild,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:00,12026045322,Ben Deane,1 first,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Peppers was a first round pick last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:15,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And can play,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Still,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:37,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think it’s terrible,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So better than a pick because half of the first rounders can’t play,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:05,12026045322,Ben Deane,If you could draft Odell this year he would go 1st overall,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:15,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s a guaranteed stud,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,Probably the best wr in the league for the next 4 years,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:39,12026045322,Ben Deane,For sure top 5,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:59,12026045322,Ben Deane,The cap space makes sense,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:09:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,But shit. They don’t have any other good players. Where is all their cap going?!,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:10:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,If they’re smart they’ll get a QB this year and then go HAM in free agency next offseason like Philly did two years ago and the Rams did last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:14:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, I’m not sure paying for a QB is the play",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:27,12026045322,Ben Deane,Yeah they have 6 and 17,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:36,12026045322,Ben Deane,Is the OSU guy tight?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Brees and Brady took pay cuts last year. Goff Mahomes Jackson Watson Trubisky and Dak were all on rookie deals,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Almost all of the playoff teams had cheap QBs,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:16:16,12026045322,Ben Deane,Very lucky that that many young QBs were that good,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:16:40,12026045322,Ben Deane,If you have mahomes you don’t drop him before he gets a big contract hoping to hit again,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:20:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I know, you pay him like Rodgers and then watch your team be terrible like GB",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:20:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then complain that your QB can’t get a defense to help him out,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,So you would get rid of mahomes?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,In a heartbeat,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Dime a dozen,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:50,12026045322,Ben Deane,Also Brady didn’t work out for the pats. Should’ve gotten rid of him,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Surrounded by ridiculous talent,,,,,

Instead of trying to recover an onside kick, teams would have the option of attempting to convert a fourth-and-15 play from their own 35-yard line. If they get the 15 yards, they get a first down and keep possession of the ball. If they don't get the 15 yards, the other team would take over possession from wherever the play ended.”",,,,,

,3/24/2019,9:16:02,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,🙋‍♂,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:16:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is this what the AAF is doing?,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:17:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Yes but they have a couple of additional requirements for it, but has been successfully done already",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:17:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s a rule for American football Dave,,,I'm lost,3/24/2019,9:15:57
,3/24/2019,9:17:42,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You remember how that works right,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:19:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m not convinced the success rate of this would be any higher than the 7% success rate of onside kicks this year though.,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:19:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4th and 15 is pretty easy to defend,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:20:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Unless you get a defensive hold then the same rules apply,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:20:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Automatic first down,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:22:55,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm pretty sure it would happen more than 7%,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:23:11,84986222184,David Casstevens,Room converted on half of 3 and 15,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:25:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Would be more than 7% and I’m ok with that,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:32:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,From 2006-2012 there were 13 of 72 4th and 10 or more converted,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:32:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4th and 20 or more was 1 for 21,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:33:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Seeing that, 4th and 10 would be better",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:33:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Something that’s closer to 20% would be great,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:35:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,This was the Ray Rice run wasn’t it,,,4th and 20 or more was 1 for 21,3/24/2019,9:32:19
,3/24/2019,9:35:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Honestly I’d rather them say the kicking team can line up 8 yards away,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:35:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Onside kick is really fun, but 10 yards is too far out",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Onside kick isn’t fun because you can get a running start,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Idk if 8 yards instead of 10 is a difference,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Can’t,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:39:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Well I’m glad they’re looking at it,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:39:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,This is the beauty of capitalism.,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Ask greenbay about statistics on onsidekicks,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,NFL stole a bunch of stuff from XFL 20 years ago too,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah maybe make it 4th and 10 but from the 20 or something,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,#toosoon,,,Ask greenbay about statistics on onsidekicks,3/24/2019,9:40:07
,3/24/2019,9:44:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The other proposal I heard was moving the kickoff up to the 45 yard line,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:45:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So kickoffs end up being touchbacks or really high like punts which the NFL likes better than the traditional kickoff,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:46:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also onside kicking from your own 45 isn’t as risky if the other team starts with it in their own territory if not successful,,,,,
,3/24/2019,18:05:30,12026045322,Ben Deane,Gronk gone!,,,,,
,3/24/2019,18:07:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is it real though?,,,,,

,3/26/2019,21:19:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not booth review,,,,,
,3/26/2019,21:20:20,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Well it’s booth review during the final 2 minutes at least for a year,,,,,
,3/26/2019,21:20:53,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Sean Payton can take a fist in the 🍑,,,,,

,3/26/2019,21:22:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I really hate booth reviews. Just give coaches 3 challenges (timeout loss if they’re wrong) and be done with it.,,,,,

,6/7/2019,8:31:47,12026045322,Ben Deane,And he wouldn’t have gotten a 500k fine,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:32:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Giant eye roll,,,People calling for the word owner to be taken away from sports owners because they treat their team like slaves,6/7/2019,8:26:04
,6/7/2019,8:33:59,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Also didn’t know ppl (the media? Probs) turned it into a race thing, but I guess that’s what we have to do knowadays",,,Cause it’s turned into a huge race thing and I don’t think it was that big of a deal,6/7/2019,8:25:29
,6/7/2019,8:36:34,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Sure, change the word owner. They’ll still be billionaires making all the decisions for the team.",,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:38:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What I saw was a part owner who had probably been drinking and was salty his team was losing,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:39:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But also, I’ve been saying for years that the fans are too close in basketball",,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:40:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It should be a platform like the Final Four was,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:52:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,Lebrons post also made it worse,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:52:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,Has 50k comments,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:14:03,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Not even competitive now, but still crazy to watch",,,I can’t believe this is still happening in 2019 2019_06_07_5E963260055AD3C691E5.jpeg,6/7/2019,7:34:42
,6/7/2019,9:14:08,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Nadal is just too good,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:23:19,84986222184,David Casstevens,What channel is this match,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:24:03,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Tennis channel,,,,,

,6/7/2019,9:28:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Rafa will be 92-2 in the French Open after this match,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:28:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Insane,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:34:30,84986222184,David Casstevens,Omg,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:34:34,84986222184,David Casstevens,I just turned it,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:34:50,84986222184,David Casstevens,And the announcers were like thanks for watching,,,,,
,6/7/2019,9:35:01,84986222184,David Casstevens,Nadal is a monster,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:22:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Bro it’s a bold opinion I wanted to hear your reasoning... would have asked anyone the same thing,,,Also love that if anyone else had said this you would have given your thoughts but since I said it I need to justify,6/7/2019,8:27:57
,6/7/2019,10:22:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My thoughts is you can’t have fans pushing atheletes,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:23:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And you should ask like sitting courtside is a privilege and respect the game and the atheletes,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:23:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But agree that if you’re getting all butt hurt for something he said then you need thicker skin as a public figure and stop being a pussy,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:25:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,This will be awesome to argue about this weekend,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:25:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Lol,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:26:05,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Very awesome,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:28:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah people stopped viewing it as a privilege when they started charging $40,000 for people to sit there",,,And you should ask like sitting courtside is a privilege and respect the game and the atheletes,6/7/2019,10:23:23
,6/7/2019,10:30:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Market forces... if people are paying for it...,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:30:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Then they can do whatever they want,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also just saw that Warriors fans are talking shit about Drake being on the court,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:34,84986222184,David Casstevens,Omg,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Saying this is what happens when they let Drake do that,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:33:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I can’t believe this is news a story,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,Pile on culture,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:34,84986222184,David Casstevens,#Americanculture,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:40,84986222184,David Casstevens,Fake outrage,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:16:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"The thing is the guy was also a part-owner of the Warriors, so you have to set yourself to a higher standard if you're representing the Warriors organization at that level",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:20:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I definitely agree with that,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:21:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Normal fan, ejection would have been the appropriate punishment",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:21:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"right, but this guy was too high profile",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:22:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"So for part-owner to get ejection, 500k fine and 1 year ban is pretty steep",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:22:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But appropriate since he’s held to a higher standard,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:23:00,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think you have to make it steep - you have to make the punishment much worse than the \""crime\""",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:23:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"otherwise, let's just say it's ejection and 100k fine - people with courtside seats could shove someone every game of every season and it wouldn't dent their wallets",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:24:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not if the court was on a platform,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:24:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But then they couldn’t charge as much for seats,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:08,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i could also see the \""normal\"" fan coming on court and shoving a player getting a lifetime ban",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like you can't have fans jumping into the court and only getting ejected,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Drake came into the court.....,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:26:03,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, wonder why basketball is the only sport to have the seats so freaking close to the court, to the point where it hinders the players from playing",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:26:26,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"he wasn't \""normal\"" though and he didn't \""physically assault\"" anyone",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:27:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,drake also is a golden state fanboy,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,he has a tattoo of curry and KDs numbers on  his arm,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I appreciate you putting physically assault in quotations,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I honestly like Drake and Spike Lee doing that stuff,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:59,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah it would be interesting what would have happened to drake if he shoved one of the players,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:29:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"but the drake thing also has a different flavor to it, because its two dudes getting in each other's faces and talking smack",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:29:40,12026152479,Bryan Lee,versus some rich part-owner shoving a player when they don't see it coming,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:34:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I love that it is,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:34:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s not quite as good as the MaGA hat kids in DC but it’s good,,,,,

,6/12/2019,17:31:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,Thing with the splash is that it’s supposed to end the game. They’re supposed to go quickly,,,,,

I immediately turned to Krista and was like “this is what’s wrong with our workforce”",,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:22:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,He’s a hypochondriac,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:22:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And calls in like every other day...it’s annoying to listen to,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:23:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But my point is that he was playing the victim when I know that he was completely fine 90% of the time he would “call in”,,,,,

,7/19/2019,17:31:10,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think it’s multiple factors,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:31:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hospitality union is pretty strong. We’re nothing compared to Chicago and New York,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:32:16,12026045322,Ben Deane,Primarily lower educated team members. Vast majority from South America or southeast,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:33:23,12026045322,Ben Deane,And I bet most people that have to manage union team members struggle with it,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:33:25,12026045322,Ben Deane,We’re also owned by a union so they know them being unionized will never be in jeopardy,,,,,

,8/5/2019,7:13:54,84986222184,David Casstevens,The industry rarely talk auction but when they do they speak as if nomination is all that they know. I think we may be the only people on earth that read players off a sheet of someones opinion on rank,,,,,

,8/5/2019,11:05:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The hype train is real in Cleveland,,,,,
,8/5/2019,11:05:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What’s their over/under on games won?,,,,,
,8/5/2019,11:20:55,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Someone on espnradio yesterday while we were driving said that the hype went from winning 1 game and getting free bud light to if they don’t win 10 games this season it’s a failure,,,,,
,8/5/2019,11:25:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would bet on them being a little better than middle of the road 9-10 wins,,,,,
,8/5/2019,11:28:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My guess is 7,,,,,
,8/5/2019,11:29:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,100%. But they knew this is what they were getting when they drafted him,,,You hate to see that if you’re the browns front office though,8/5/2019,11:03:43

,8/5/2019,11:30:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The O/U is 9,,,I would bet on them being a little better than middle of the road 9-10 wins,8/5/2019,11:25:34
,8/5/2019,11:30:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Gunters gotta love 8.5 for the Falcs,,,,,

,8/8/2019,15:21:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I think that’s right,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Gotta roll the 🎲,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’ll take 5/1 if you give it to me?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:47,12026045322,Ben Deane,For saquon?!,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:04,12026045322,Ben Deane,It would be a guaranteed loss for me,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah basically cancel your bet for $10,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,I’m good,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:23:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,This definitely seems more legit,,,I’ll take 5/1 if you give it to me?,8/8/2019,15:21:36
,8/8/2019,15:23:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But on the other hand, Ben was talkin shit",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:24:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I think this is too high,,,$120 ,8/8/2019,14:52:49
,8/8/2019,15:24:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,$80 for the rest of the roster is rough,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:25:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"After a solid WR, you have All below average players",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:30:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Preach,,,I still wouldn’t go over 100,8/8/2019,14:54:23
,8/8/2019,15:31:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’d pay $70 for an RB that you’re admiring only has a 20% chance to finish as first but only $100 for someone who is guaranteed first?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:31:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"No, I’ve never paid $70 for the top RB",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:33:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Scotty got the rb1 last year for like $55,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:33:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,How’d that shot work out for him?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:35:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I forgot the last couple years we’ve chilled right now,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:35:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Chilled right out,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:36:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So yeah maybe $120 is too much,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:36:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe y’all are right... def not under 100 though,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:37:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Even if you got a WR2 after, the rest of your roster is scrubs",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:37:56,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You can’t wait with scrubs,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:00,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Win,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Very true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Sure but you can win with the best player and a bunch of average players,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But I don’t think you’re even getting average,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Ben trying winning with scrubs for like the first 3 years he was in the league,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like $100 is the price of your top 2,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:01,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Never worked,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"So you’re just saying instead of 2 top players, you’re getting a guaranteed 1",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Then the rest of your team is the same,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:02,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You’re getting God tier RB and tier 3 everyone else,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I just don’t think it works,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:34,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You’re relying on sleepers at that point,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:42:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I saw a 2qb ranking that had Mahomes at #4 overall,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:42:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Ridiculous,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:44:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And Peter Schrager said Kyler Murray excitement this year is the same as Mahomes excitement was last year at training camp,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:53:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"FYI I’m sending out the survey tonight, so last chance for any ideas to the email thread",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:59:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Krista reminder to include a question asking for respondent name so we know who we are waiting on,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:05:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Bryan and Dave be like 2019_08_08_160557_3A827C488A2C2185B8D5.mp4,GIF,2019_08_08_160557_3A827C488A2C2185B8D5.gif,Krista reminder to include a question asking for respondent name so we know who we are waiting on,8/8/2019,15:59:05

,8/8/2019,16:50:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc and Mark,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:50:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,15 points feels too much for a shut out,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:51:14,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And the difference between 0 and 7 is bonkers (15 to 6),,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:51:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I lose 9 points because someone scored a TD on me!?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Shutouts are less than 1% in the last decade,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s too painful and not at all representative of actually game value since both are great defensive games,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Dunc has a point that it should be highly rewarded,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:03,12026045322,Ben Deane,If a defense has a shutout they have so many points already,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:27,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think 1-9 should be highly rewarded,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Well if we’re talking representative, we need defenses to be much more valuable overall",,,That’s too painful and not at all representative of actually game value since both are great defensive games,8/8/2019,16:53:11
,8/8/2019,16:55:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Last time a Super Bowl team didn’t have a top 10 defense was Peyton’s 2006 Colts,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:56:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,I wonder what that stat on offense is,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:56:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Great question, I’ll research that tonight",,,I wonder what that stat on offense is,8/8/2019,16:56:14
,8/8/2019,16:57:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but I think making defenses too powerful in fantasy without going IDP takes some of the skill out of it in my opinion,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m guessing the Seahawks are the only ones this century,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But how do you measure “top 10 defense” according to your stat?  It’s not the same measures that make a good fantasy defense,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And that’s my issue,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:59:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Points Against.,,,But how do you measure “top 10 defense” according to your stat?  It’s not the same measures that make a good fantasy defense,8/8/2019,16:57:53
,8/8/2019,16:59:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And I agree with your point, which is why Dunc’s scale should help with that",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:01:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I agree we need a revamp of the scoring system for points to matter more,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:02:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe we make points matter a ton and the rest of the shit matter less,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:02:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I also agree with this. I don’t want to make defense too powerful, just at least in the same league as the other positions",,,Yeah but I think making defenses too powerful in fantasy without going IDP takes some of the skill out of it in my opinion,8/8/2019,16:57:00
,8/8/2019,17:04:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Touchdowns are big swings which seems to bother people,,,Maybe we make points matter a ton and the rest of the shit matter less,8/8/2019,17:02:21
,8/8/2019,17:09:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Even though when Austin Hooper’s ass scored 3 TDs against me, I didn’t say we need to restructure how TEs score",,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:13:24,14344222842,Luke Wray,Dumbest shit I've ever heard scooter,,,I heard JJ wanted a trade to TB,8/8/2019,11:59:13
,8/8/2019,17:15:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I was guessing he was just trolling you,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Nah,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:09,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Heard it on dan lebatard,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yesterday,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Gtfoh,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:36,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yup,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"I didn’t put much merit to it, but they talked for a good while about it",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:18:25,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The segment started with JJ breaking that kids bike and if he should buy the kid a new bike,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:19:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And they talked about that for 10 min...then another 10 min about him wanting a trade and Clouney being a FA next year,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,What’s the stat for the reverse of this? For teams that allow 35+ points a game,,,Shutouts are less than 1% in the last decade,8/8/2019,16:53:05
,8/8/2019,17:20:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I think a shutout should be rewarded, but not so severe.",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:33,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Actually I think defenses should be punished more heavily for allowing more points,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It should be like -10 for allowing 35+ in a game,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:21:37,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But if that’s also around 1% of games in a season then idk,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Absolutely u should give 15 for a shutout...you have guaranteed ur team a win,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,In real fb,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But that also means the defense did well in other areas were already giving points for,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,A shutout should be the equivalent of an offensive player having a 45 point game....with all the 3 and outs and such it probably is,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:16,15408158419,Scott Gunter,15 is not too much,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Sacks/picks/4th down stops etc,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:33,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Excellent,,,But that also means the defense did well in other areas were already giving points for,8/8/2019,17:22:49
,8/8/2019,17:23:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,A def with a shutout should get like 45,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:32,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But like we need to make these decisions this week bc it alters my whole draft strategy,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:33,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is that what we want for defenses though?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:38,14344222842,Luke Wray,Why dont we just get rid of def?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,There it is,,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:26:07,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Luke I would be happy to include an option for getting rid of defenses on the survey,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:26:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Like a yes/no question,,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:27:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:27:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Like 10,000 pounds",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:33:32,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think we could reduce the ways that DEF score points in other ways (sacks, interception, etc) since we are increasing the weight on points allowed.  Im not sure.  I just feel like points allowed should matter more than it does",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:34:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But the whole point of adding those other things was to make people excited about def,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:16,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah and it's nice to value the tangible, measurable things that a DEF does",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Exactly,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:42,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Guys...we over here talkin bout practice,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,15 points will not happen this year,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:59,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I guarantee it,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:39:08,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I like points allowed because its partially a measure of things that we can't measure about a def, like how good they are at stopping a play quickly or having good coverage",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:39:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Three and outs are good for that too,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:43:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Lol,,,Luke is the antifa of FF,8/8/2019,17:25:27

,8/8/2019,17:46:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This can’t be true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:46:25,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I just looked at every score from every week last year,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:46:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So yes it’s true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:47:29,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Including 24-0 eagles over skins week 17, so that def would have scored like 40 something according to the proposed new scoring",,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:47:47,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Get em Luke,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:48:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Was going off of this stat,,,But if that’s also around 1% of games in a season then idk,8/8/2019,17:21:37
,8/8/2019,17:50:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s closer to like 3% of games in the season are shutouts,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe the problem is that we’re duplicating - points against a defense should be the primary factor that gives defense fantasy points,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,True...but that’s not fun to watch,,,Maybe the problem is that we’re duplicating - points against a defense should be the primary factor that gives defense fantasy points,8/8/2019,17:50:04
,8/8/2019,17:50:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:46,14344222842,Luke Wray,So let's say a defense goes ham one week,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But defensive touchdowns also help the team a ton but wouldn’t show up in points against,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:59,14344222842,Luke Wray,What point total do they deserve?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But a def that has a shut out is like a wr having 200 yds and 2 tds,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Should be like 40 points,,,,,

,8/12/2019,11:39:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,Lol,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:40:52,84986222184,David Casstevens,Its an extra wrinkle to think about first the next three weeks. Then when we get in the draft room we will see how good everyone's poker face is,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:41:04,84986222184,David Casstevens,😳😳,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:07,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I wanna see everyone’s face 10 min before the draft starts if we do the random generator then,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,That’s how you’ll know,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:36,18048190003,Krista Gunter,There isn’t any strategy to knowing the order now,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,There is tons,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:58,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"If I’m first and I go TE to fuck you up, it throws off your entire plan",,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:47:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Or if I go like tier 5 WR,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:47:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Def fucks me up,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:47:45,84986222184,David Casstevens,Or does it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think we should at least have one week,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Everyone is gonna be too chickenshit to make a nom anyway,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,That’s why I said the week of,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Or we could have a generation day,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Like 5 days before,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:37,84986222184,David Casstevens,On the saturday of the third preseason gamr,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:48:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Game,,,,,

,8/12/2019,12:16:59,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Pat do you have the loser shirt and the belt,,,,,
,8/12/2019,12:17:02,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Gotta bring both,,,,,
,8/12/2019,12:20:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Will bring both, will only be wearing one of them",,,,,
,8/12/2019,12:32:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"The loser shirt, we know",,,,,
,8/12/2019,12:52:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah, so you cant come with a specific game plan",,,I think we should generate the nomination list at the beginning of the draft,8/12/2019,10:30:14
,8/12/2019,13:10:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"also, i think we should be able to use whatever tools for draft day",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:14:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Stephen a going OFF on AB,,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:14:23,14344222842,Luke Wray,I had to turn the channel,,,Stephen a going OFF on AB,8/12/2019,13:14:03
,8/12/2019,13:21:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Sir you need to calm down with that tone of yours,,,"also, i think we should be able to use whatever tools for draft day",8/12/2019,13:10:29
,8/12/2019,13:22:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"lol, we haven't had restrictions before",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:22:32,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Is it a tool that is available to everyone, or something you want to keep secret",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:22:41,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"if the goal is to make the draft an even playing field, then we should all have the opportunity to have the exact same tools",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:23:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think the draft tools that update during draft make for a more competitive draft, which I like",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:24:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"otherwise, it's the people with the best spreadsheet skills that will have an advantage",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:24:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,because you can essentially create an auto-updating tool within spreadsheets,,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:58:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"That's kind of what I was saying, technically a sufficiently impressive spreadsheet approaches the utility of software",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:59:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Then it’s just an expert draft,,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:59:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The experts that made my app vs the ones that made yours,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:00:08,12026152479,Bryan Lee,There's still skill involved in making the decisions,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:00:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Much less,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:01:42,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I think it's better to have a more competitive draft though,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:02:06,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Why?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:02:33,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I think it's more fun when it's more competitive. Both during the draft and during the season,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Equality of outcome, huh?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Its not as fun if there are clear runaway winners and losers,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,No equality of opportunity,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Exact opposite,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:04:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You want no clear winners or losers of the draft,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:04:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also you want us all using virtual draft assistants during the draft?  That can’t be more fun,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:06:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This isn’t true,,,"That's kind of what I was saying, technically a sufficiently impressive spreadsheet approaches the utility of software",8/12/2019,13:58:03
,8/12/2019,14:06:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,My brain is basically a virtual draft assistant. Is that cheating?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Only if Bry and Dunc get their way Ben,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Then you won’t be able to use your brain,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:22,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hahaha,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,I barely do anyway so we good!!!,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:08:04,12026045322,Ben Deane,God I’m gonna run circles around you fools again,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:08:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The reason this isn’t true is you need to make all types of assumptions and shit when updating your ranks and expected costs on the fly,,,This isn’t true,8/12/2019,14:06:16
,8/12/2019,14:08:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Having a computer do that for you means using the skill and knowledge and assumption of experts,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:09:11,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think it elevates the level of strategy when you have most of the book keeping type things automated for you on the fly,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:09:38,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like the human + computer chess matches, computer is good at keeping track of the low level tactics, so it frees the human up to focus on higher level strategy",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"if your entire draft is just scrambling to see how many WRs are left, how much budget you have left, who has drafted who, it's very low level strategy",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Hey Bryan, we out here playing chess and pats playing checkers! N’am saying?!?!",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What strategy is left when a draft assistant updates the expected cost of every player according to your team and what people have paid for previous players?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,hahhah exactly,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,there's a lot of strategy left,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:49,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pat so mad at me right now,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahaha,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you used an assistant last year, if you follow it blindly it doesn't do shit for you",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m arguing for fun,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,There’s no way this gets passed in a vote so this doesn’t really matter,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:33,12026045322,Ben Deane,That’s only true if everyone is using it,,,"you used an assistant last year, if you follow it blindly it doesn't do shit for you",8/12/2019,14:11:05
,8/12/2019,14:11:35,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah it's more fun to not worry about basic book keeping during the draft and updating draft dollars,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My spreadsheet is just rank aggregations and notes, I have to do all the value assessments on the fly like everyone else",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But what strategy is left Bry?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:11,12026152479,Bryan Lee,composing a good team,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:22,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah this is a huge difference,,,"My spreadsheet is just rank aggregations and notes, I have to do all the value assessments on the fly like everyone else",8/12/2019,14:11:55
,8/12/2019,14:12:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But if you got crazy you could have a spreadsheet do the value assessments too,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Or at least help you,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:41,12026045322,Ben Deane,We still got marky out here!,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You can’t really Dunc,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Mark over here like “hole up Sarah this is important”,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,I feel like I’m providing some good color commentary right now,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:23,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you have to decide when you should overpay or wait, you still can decide to go 0 RB or not, you can go heavy on QBs, you can go studs n duds or a bunch of avg joes",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,you can see what players or positions other people need to fill and try and screw up their strategy,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you decide when to disagree with your app,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I need to change what I'm doing this year to be able to handle nominations.  That's a huge change,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:12,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Bryan, why doesn’t your first letter in your sentence get capitalized?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:20,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah i mean that's the thing with all of this, even in snake drafts, if you just blindly follow the ADP cheat sheets, you'll have a horribel draft",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s talking,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Oh,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Not typing,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,That’s cheating ma dude,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:44,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"lol, I don't know, probably because i'm typing on a computer, not on a phone",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:15:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pat answering my questions all fast so I go away,,,,,

,8/12/2019,14:16:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,and what about real NFL team managers? they all have access to the same info,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:31,12026152479,Bryan Lee,there's still strategy involved,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"No I actually didn’t use it that much, but definitely used it as a macro guide to where value was left",,,"pat, when you used your assistant last year, did you just follow the exact $ numbers for each player and just try to bid to that number and that's it?",8/12/2019,14:15:23
,8/12/2019,14:16:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I could have followed it to the letter,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And that’s what we did for our #bensfriend league pretty much,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think if you follow it to the letter, you'll end up drafting poorly",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:30,12026152479,Bryan Lee,it's like following a cheat sheet using ADP in a snake draft,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s not because that doesn’t update,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:06,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This draft assistant updates live based on your team,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you don't need it to update, you just take whoever is at the top of the ADP who hasn't yet been selected",,,,,

,8/12/2019,14:18:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Where as these do,,,,,

,8/12/2019,14:28:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like when NFL teams are in the draft choosing who to take next, they're not bogged down in trying to figure out logistical items, they have a team for that and they have algorithms, their job is to make the big decisions on who to go with once they have all of the data available to them",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:29:03,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"we want to be like the top decision maker in our drafts, not the role of the software or assistant who is just aggregating information",,,,,

,8/12/2019,16:38:56,14344222842,Luke Wray,Just thought of this and wanted to make sure it was a rule,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:38:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I thought we would go in order and circle like we’ve always done,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:39:37,14344222842,Luke Wray,We could snake for the first 2 rounds then circle?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:39:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I dunno,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:40:16,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My thoughts are that we should do circle,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:40:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But I don’t have any real strong objections to snake,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:40:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I just want to establish the rotation before we assign numbers,,,,,

,8/12/2019,18:49:20,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think we should do circle from the start,,,,,
,8/12/2019,18:50:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and make the order random and revealed one at a time as the nominations come up, i.e. pick a name out of a hat, that person nominates first, pick another name out of a hat, that person nominates second, etc. and then we'll have the established order",,,,,
,8/12/2019,18:50:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,this way it limits the advantage of people getting to nominate earlier if they don't know when they'll actually go,,,,,

,8/12/2019,19:35:41,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm pretty sure if I was using one it would be an extreme advantage for me. There are analytics and there are manalytics,,,,,

,8/12/2019,19:51:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,Okay so my guess is that Bryan and Duncan use it. Well they both haven't had a bad team in three years. Everyone else has had at least one stinker. Maybe it does safeguard you from drafting an atrocious team. I dunno,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:51:45,84986222184,David Casstevens,Duncan what are you thinking,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:52:42,84986222184,David Casstevens,Do you think it is an advantage for you. Your teams have been top 4 for 4 years straight or is it because you are just an amazing drafter?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:55:31,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Duncan and Bryan (except 1 year a piece) have made the playoffs every year since 2010,,,,,

,8/12/2019,20:05:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,Is that fair to say,,,,,
,8/12/2019,20:08:42,12026152479,Bryan Lee,well i've only used the tool last 3 years,,,,,
,8/12/2019,20:09:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So either just luck or some skill involved,,,,,
,8/12/2019,20:09:46,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I only use my spreadsheet,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:24:12,14344222842,Luke Wray,I second the motion,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:24:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think Pat says the phrase “rule change” and immediately gets a boner,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:29:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would vote to use it. Anyone who doesn’t use it is making that choice,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:31:14,14344222842,Luke Wray,I dont like this. It gets the feeling like we need to put in a ton of research and buy fancy draft things to have a chance,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:31:36,14344222842,Luke Wray,I like keeping it simple and everyone having equal chance to win and having fun,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:34:40,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Or disclose where you got it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:34:47,18048190003,Krista Gunter,And then if people want to use it fine,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:05,14344222842,Luke Wray,Why has it even come to this wtf,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I agree with this,,,So much goes into the season more than the draft,8/12/2019,22:28:39

,8/12/2019,23:04:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think we should go with a free market and everyone is free to draft the way they enjoy more and find more fun, if you like taking the analytical approach than you can go that way, if you like going with your gut and instincts, then you can do that too",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:05:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think if we really think it presents an unfair advantage then anyone who decides to use a tool or use a spreadsheet must share it openly with everyone else and it must be free, so anyone can use it during the draft",,,,,

,8/12/2019,23:15:58,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And prolly Duncan,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:17:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,well i think we need to get more specific with what we're banning,,,,,

,8/12/2019,23:18:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This,,,I think u should be allowed to look up whatever u want with regards to recommendations and stats but u shouldn’t be allowed to update a model or spreadsheet that adapts those recommendations based on our draft,8/12/2019,16:11:10
,8/12/2019,23:18:51,12026152479,Bryan Lee,what do you mean by recommendations based on our draft? and model or spreadsheet that adapts? like would our spreadsheet used to track our teams fall into this?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:18:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Well I’m proposing we vote on options,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And I want that to be an option,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:04,12026152479,Bryan Lee,it updates remaining $$ by team according to drafted players,,,,,

,8/12/2019,23:19:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, which is why I just want clarity on what we're banning versus not",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:20:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Do you have to input something into ur research? If so, prolly not allowed",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:20:43,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Unless it’s league rules,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:21:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like am I allowed to keep track of how much $ is being spent per team on position?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:21:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"or how much I've spent per position, have a budget for a position, and have that budget be eaten into as I draft players?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bry ur getting extreme,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:17,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur asking “am I allowed to budget”,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,because excel or spreadsheets are literally just models that update,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The answer is it depends,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Did u build the spreadsheet?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i know we're allowed to budget, what i don't know is if we're allowed to automatically update budgets based upon draft choices",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:15,12026152479,Bryan Lee,does it matter if i build it or not?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yes,,,does it matter if i build it or not?,8/12/2019,23:23:15
,8/12/2019,23:23:32,12026152479,Bryan Lee,then we're saying the person with the best excel skills will have an advantage over those who don't,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:33,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Very much so,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Doesn’t have to be excel,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Best budgeting skills yes,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:32,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also this is just my opinion,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:46,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m only 10% of the population,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And we should vote on it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i mean i think your opinion matters a lot though if your the one putting forward a motion to ban something",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:25:43,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like i'm the kind of person that will use technology to try and get an advantage, and i'll take it up to the line of what's allowed, without cheating",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:26:36,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"so i'm okay if we ban any outside tool/spreadsheet, we have to be able to build all of our tools we want to use, i just need to know what i can build",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:27:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"So my opinion is that if ur paying or receiving information that adapts in real time based on the draft that is outside ur person, ur over the line",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:27:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,"so i'm okay if we ban any outside tool/spreadsheet, we have to be able to build all of our tools we want to use, i just need to know what i can build",8/12/2019,23:26:36

,8/13/2019,7:07:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I would describe it as any external software (not built by you) that requires real time inputs and updates during the draft,,,,,

,8/14/2019,9:35:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think it’s random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,9:36:06,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It is random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,9:36:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And there’s no way to change it,,,,,
,8/14/2019,9:48:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Other than, I assume, recreating the season/league in Yahoo",,,And there’s no way to change it,8/14/2019,9:36:19

,8/14/2019,10:24:25,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So either automatic or shuffle one time,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:16:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m ok with an automated shuffle but the last 3 years have been the same,,,,,

,8/14/2019,11:27:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"In the Calcutta league that I do with the dads here, you can buy extra draft $$$ for 2:1",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:27:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But Calcutta is straight sports betting and not a team of players,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:27:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Whoa,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:28:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It would prevents the really good teams from going for too little,,,,,

,8/14/2019,11:29:17,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I kinda want to do it for nfl,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:29:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,We are def doing it for the playoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:31:38,12026045322,Ben Deane,Wtf is Calcutta,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:31:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So let’s take the nfl playoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:32:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,We auction off teams just like we do with players,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:32:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"If ur team wins first round, you get a % of the pot",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:32:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And the % gets higher as you get to the SB,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:33:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So like let’s say the pot is $1000,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:33:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And you take the jags for $5...and the first round is 2%,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:33:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur getting 4:1 for them to take the first game,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:01,12026045322,Ben Deane,Love that. But it’s basically the same thing we do. We just pay out at the end,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,Also FYI. I’m getting a betting account this year,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The differnce is ours is blind,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So I get $200 if Jags win first round,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:31,12026045322,Ben Deane,Can’t wait around for these apps to get it together,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s awesome,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:44,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Mark doesn’t teach math thank god,,,So I get $200 if Jags win first round,8/14/2019,11:34:26
,8/14/2019,11:34:49,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What do you get for the second round?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:34:59,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Percentages go up,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So second round might be 8%,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,$800 if the Jags win the second round??!,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It’s AWESOME for march madness,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,You can’t beat that for $5,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What a steal,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Mark,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:35:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Divide all ur answers by 10,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:36:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I only get $2 if they win the first round?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:36:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not worth it,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:36:44,12026045322,Ben Deane,HahahahHa this is cracking me up,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:37:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Mark!,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:37:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur retarded,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:38:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That sounds much better than current playoff pool to be honest,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:38:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"It’s basically the exact same thing, but bids aren’t blind",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And more payoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The only blind part is u don’t know what the total pool is at until the end,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I love it,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But there’s one other rule,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So everyone can buy in with $100,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"If u only spend $30, you only spend $30",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But everything over $100 is 2:1,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:15,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So $110 bid costs me $120,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Why would we do that?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What’s the point of that rule?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:44,15408158419,Scott Gunter,2 reasons,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,1- it prevents a #1 team for going way too cheap,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,otherwise one person could buy every team in every round?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:17,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And 2- what Bryan said,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It entices more people to bid,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc people get close to $100 and don’t wanna go into luxury tax,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:42:01,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is Bernie Sanders in this league?,,,But everything over $100 is 2:1,8/14/2019,11:40:02
,8/14/2019,11:42:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Mark- did u get hit in the head at the hospital or something?,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:13:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My opinion is that there’s no way they would code it to use seeding or prior data of any kind...it has to use a “shuffle”,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:19:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My thought is that they randomly assign a number to each team 1-10 and then they have a schedule template where 1 plays 3 week 1 and so on,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:19:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This would imply a random generation of who plays who,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:19:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ie you have the same chance of playing me as you would Ben,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:20:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"So from 2016-2017, there’s a 10% chance it’s the same",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:20:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The template probably doesn’t change from year to year,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:21:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But in no way do they use any prior data from our league to generate the schedule,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:23:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think there's got to be more than 10 templates for a 10 person league.  That would suggest that the order within a season remains the same each year,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:24:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Ah but you could be right, assigning a random number and then assigning random template of 10",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:25:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Still that's way more than 10 possible schedules,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:26:31,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"My point is if it were PURE stats, then it’s 1:10000000 or whatever, but that can’t be what they do",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:26:41,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It has to be 1 template,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:26:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,With random team # assignment,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:27:23,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Which would be everyone has the same % to play everyone ...which implies randomness,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:28:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Probability is hard,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:29:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think in this case, the simplest explanation is the most likely one. Either we didn't set the schedule to be random that year and we did the other years, or their algorithm for that one year was different than the other years, and maybe it just copied the schedule from last year's season if there were no change in players",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:31:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"either of which, if the bet was made around the schedules being 100% random in the entirety of the league history, then that's not true, and pat would win the bet",,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:40:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So it’s an assumption,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:41:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, and so is a DNA test match, but the odds are so minuscule that it can be used as incontrovertible evidence in a trial",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:41:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,there's no way an entire season schedule can be the same by chance,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:42:33,12026152479,Bryan Lee,that's also based on an assumption,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:43:04,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But my point is that a complete random isn’t 1:100000000,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:46:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Something must be going on with their servers,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:49:55,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so there must be at least 40 templates at a minimum,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Maybe,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Maybe there’s 1 but it gets updates,,,,,

,8/14/2019,14:42:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also the 8 (not 10) template theory is debunked by Bry,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:43:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Either way the fact that it was the same 2 years in a row means that it can’t be completely random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:43:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Any amount of randomness would make the probably of getting the same schedule almost impossible,,,,,

,8/18/2019,23:49:33,84986222184,David Casstevens,Its dead on,,,,,
8/19/2019,8/19/2019,7:48:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I just love that we don’t all have a common list that we’re working off of for the draft this year,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:05,84986222184,David Casstevens,Right,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:09,84986222184,David Casstevens,So great,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:30,84986222184,David Casstevens,Basically everyone is their own analyist,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:25:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So we still need to vote on IR spot and to ban in-draft analyzing apps?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:25:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat has some interesting thoughts on IR spot,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:33:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,What are we doing about FA,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:40:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Great call,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:41:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think we should just do away with the 11am rule and go back to the way it was,,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:10:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If you don’t $0 faab bid, then Dave will have an advantage on you",,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:11:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But if you forget to $0 faab bid, that’s on you anyway",,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:12:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,And it multiple people have $0 faab for a player then it defaults to the waiver list,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:09,12026045322,Ben Deane,So Dunc,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:13,12026045322,Ben Deane,I was thinking,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:48,12026045322,Ben Deane,"You need to figure out a way to automate your rankings, charge like $50 a league per year and make about 10 billion dollars",,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:47:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,It’s the toughest thing ever,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:47:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,Everyone would pay,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Yeah Yahoo should hire me,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,Fuck yahoo,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Advertise that shit on Instagram, god you would make so much money",,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:57:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I know, it would be awesome to automate it.  It's possible, though not a small lift",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:00:55,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I don't think it would be too complicated if done as a web app,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:02:28,12406785346,Duncan Bell,It WOULD make so much money if done right,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:16:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Mark do you remember your 2007 season?  It turns out that was the third best point performance in the league history, yet you came in last place",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:19:09,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i have a hard time seeing the service being profitable, but i think it could be a good acquisition target by someone like Yahoo - since them offering this kind of multi-year league analysis would help prevent people from moving their league to another platform",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:19:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There's a big market, and if sold as subscription....",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:21:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,the problem is that the value of the service would only show up once a year and for a brief period,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:21:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"it's like a \""oh, nice to know\"" kind of thing - something that would be a feature of a platform like yahoo or espn",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:00,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's true.  But I think there's a big enough market that you'd make money.  And then each year you charge to update existing customers with latest league data,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,I wonder how many leagues there are,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:35,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i don't think you could charge very much though,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:44,12026045322,Ben Deane,$50 a year?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:52,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would easily pay $5 to get this,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:53,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like even fully featured services like Fantasy pros is cheaper than $50/year,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:08,12026045322,Ben Deane,Does fantasy pros do all this?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:28,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would pay $50/ year by my self to have this,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they give you ongoing news, expert analysis, up to date analytics to start/sit, draft kits, cheat sheets, waiver wire, etc.",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:25:32,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and a business model where you charge per league is awkward, because you then have to get a bunch of people to pool their money together to make a payment for a league thing",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:26:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's a good point.  Anyway yeah I think $50 might be too high.  All of this depends also on how much it would cost to develop,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:28:54,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"the current bias of the fantasy service/tool market, is that people are willing to pay $ in order to get a competitive edge over their competition, but all of the analysis, news and stuff are all free",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:29:24,14344222842,Luke Wray,@15408158419 did dude take the trade?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:29:54,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and it'd be very easy for a competitor to replicate, within the league software and not have to log into a separate service",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:39:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Also true.  But I guess the hope would be to get acquired by Yahoo or ESPN,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:47:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i think the only way for that to happen though, is to have a ton of users - because if it's just the historical analysis, they'll probably just copy it with an in-house development team",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:47:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so they'd be acquiring primarily the user base and secondarily the analysis,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:48:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so maybe free service with ads would actually be the best route to both get a lot of users and to help pay for your costs,,,,,

,8/24/2019,10:50:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yes,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:50:27,84986222184,David Casstevens,100%,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:54:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,It makes the draft so much better and we have all these extra positions and we didn't extend the bench,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:56:40,84986222184,David Casstevens,Also we have three receiver slots which means if one is injured and another is on by you have to carry 5 just to fill oit a team,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:58:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,And last year I would have been able to keep Henry and Winston to waivers. #bullshit #yourwelcomeben,,,,,

,8/24/2019,11:16:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’d be cool to vote on that as part of the IR vote,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:16:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That would be a good way of breaking the IR tie,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:17:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah me too, but all questions should have only two options for final vote",,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:17:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But we didn’t make any progress on the IR vote,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:18:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Think we need to consider that we might need 2 more votes on IR/bench,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:19:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,One of the options had 4 votes,,,But we didn’t make any progress on the IR vote,8/24/2019,11:17:37
,8/24/2019,11:19:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Just do that one against extra bench spot,,,,,

,8/28/2019,14:30:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"By this logic you are saying that order of nominations will be more important toward the end of the draft, correct?",,,In my view we cannot do random the whole way.  At the end of the draft when players are going for $1 getting to nominate is a bigger deal.  We need to switch to circle or snake at that point.,8/27/2019,22:57:33
,8/28/2019,14:30:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If so, we for sure shouldn’t do circle since it’s the most advantageous structure",,,,,

,9/3/2019,21:40:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean no ill will but when rbs are that slight of build the chance is definitely there,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:40:04,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Not sure. He was fairly pedestrian when he started after Cook went out.  Yeah the Vikes Oline was bad, but I would say hes a solid RB2 at that point. I dont get the hype some folks have if Kamara would miss time",,,,,

,9/3/2019,21:41:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,Actually I think scantling might be 80% of kupp on AR's fuck you tour,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:42:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,So I might not need kupp,,,,,
