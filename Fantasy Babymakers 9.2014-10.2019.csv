,7/16/2016,,,Patrick Deane,I've convinced myself of 8 points per yard,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,It would be a big pain.  I think we can make a pretty good judgment,Text,,,,

,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"We can also consider .4, .3 points per reception of we think .5 is too much",Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"I think the goal here is to balance the value of wr and rb positions, to keep things interesting",Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"So if an RB gets 100 yards, he used to get 10 points, but with 8 he'd get 12.5 points?",Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"And with 9 yards per point, he'd get 11.",Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Yup,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,And the top RBs averaged about 3 catches per game last year.,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,So an extra 1.5 points.,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Best way to think about this is in terms of weekly total yardage I think,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"I figure on average between 300-500 yards between all players per week.  So if it's 400 that's 40 points or 50 points, 10 yards vs 8 yards",Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"Yeah for ppr it impacts things a little more unevenly, kind of has a normalizing effect",Text,,,,

,7/16/2016,,,Krista Gunter,And you need to take the survey,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Krista Gunter,No draft dollars,Text,,,,
,7/16/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"No on 2 QB league, but the flex has the option of QB",Text,,,,

,8/20/2016,,,Duncan Bell,It would be cool to see how new scoring would impact the past seasons - but that would require me to harvest individual game and player data which I don't have,Text,,,,

,8/21/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Top 3 finish is a little dubious I think because it can be so random.  But there is the clutch factor,Text,,,,
,8/21/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"I like points against because is helps to control for cases where people have an easier time of it, vs getting fucked",Text,,,,

,8/28/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Patty that makes me feel sad 😕,Text,,,,
,8/28/2016,,,David Casstevens,Well I don't want to keep pissing people off. If you guys want to redraft and I step away my feelings won't get hurt. Nbd just let me know. Scotty got pissed Luke got mad maybe it's just not worth it,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Scotty your call,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,I am purposefully not picking anyone up right now and am waiting until 8 EST while we decide on this rule.  Still fucks Bry though... We could do 8 SF time?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,I think 8am SF time sounds fair.,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Then who gets the player once he's back available?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Maybe we would have to make it random at that point,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Scott Gunter,I feel like the person that calls them out should get the person,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Scott Gunter,It shows that they had first interest,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,That sounds incorrect.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Scott Gunter,No way,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Oh and pat I figured out why it wasn't as fun this year.... everyone didn't blow their load on the first ten players and allow you to gobble up all the players you wanted. Bahahahah. AmIright???,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Bryan FYI the composite rankings should not be too affected by the rule change since I base everything off # of stdevs from mean points,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Watched 3 episodes this weekend,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Alright guys... I'm taking inspiration from Dave and doing my top 10 values of the draft,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,In order....,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,10. Tom Brady for $20 (Mark),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,9. Phil Rivers for $11 (KJ),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,8. Marvin Jones for $5 (Dave),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,7. Ryan Matthews for $3 (Bry),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I fucking love this,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,6. Eric Decker for $11 (Bry),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,5. Cam Newton for $38 (Pat),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,4. Jeremy Maclin for $18 (Bry),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Aaaaand the top 3....,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Which are all bonkers in my opinion,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,3. ANTONIO BROWN FOR $54 (Kris),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,2. JEREMY LANGFORD FOR $6 (Dave),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,The biggest value of the draft in my opinion,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,1. ARIAN FOSTER FOR $4 (Luke),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,LOL at the most expensive player being the 3rd best value.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,"Honourable mentions: Carlos Hyde (Mark), Jonathan Stewart (Pat), Travis Kelce (Pat), Keenan Allen (Pat), Drew Brees (Bry), Julio Jones (Dunc), LeSean McCoy (Luke), Donte Moncrief (Luke), LeGarrette Blount (Scotty)",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Whoops Keenan Allen was Ben,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Haha Ben barely squeezed one out and you almost didn't give him credit!,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Haha yeah my bad,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,How much did CJ Anderson go for?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,19,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"yeah dude, i was about to say, if you give Carlos Hyde an honorable mention, i think you have to give CJ",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Antonio brown was great value...yeah,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Yeah maybe on CJ... Everyone knows I like Hyde way too much though,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,I think Antonio went at market value.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,27% of total salary sounds about right for #1 receiver.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,And Julio and OBJ were overpaid?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Those 3 all have #1 potential.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,I think Antonio Brown is a whole tier above those two,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i think he was really great value at $54,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,I agree with Bry,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i think Cam was the best value of the draft,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,"The way things shook out, I think he was a value",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Yeah Cam was great,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"If Josh Gordon can possibly stop smoking weed, he will far and away be the best value of the draft.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"yeah, the fact that WR2s were still going for like $30 makes AB a great value",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i think the risk of josh gordon was factored into his draft price - possibly being too expensive for the amount of risk,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,I'm also not sure that bench players should be considered top values.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,Do a top 10 Marky!,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i wanna see a ranking of all teams,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Dammit, alright I'm on it.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,All those guys on my list def have potentials to be starters,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,I'm pissed that games don't start for 10 days,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Patrick Deane,This is the worst,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Ha! Everyone needs to do a top ten. And pat you are right if a player is on your bench and he really is a starter than that makes it even better value. Langford BTW was a freaking steal. Also cam definitely should have went for a lot more,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Wow pat picked up the number 1 and number 2 rookie WR's,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,All reports are disappointing coming out about Coates,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I think C.J. is going to have a monster come back year. Also the Broncos still don't know who their QB is. Jesus. And Brock looked good,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,"Well he definitely passed my eyeball test and we all know my success rate with rookie WR'S. Beckham,Benjamin",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,We will see though,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Haha and you loved Manziel too,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Best draft. Best team. First place. Krista wins.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,He is a qb. And I didn't know he was an alcoholic. The dude balled out when he played last year,Text,,,,

,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"2. Kelvin Benjamin, $13",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"1. JOSH GORDON, $14",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Krista Gunter,This is the worst top 10,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Oh shit that just gave me a great idea.... I'm going to be sending out the top ten most over paid players,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,List to come,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Hahaha,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Those guys are going to get ridiculous Return On Investment.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I agree with rashad and c.j.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Josh Gordon will be a top 5 receiver weekly from week 5 on.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,And these are my favorite fliers.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,he could also be a bust,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I can't believe no one is saying anything about the huge bounce back season Gio is going to have. I mean he only had three touches for 25 yards and 27 yards on two catches and a touchdown in yesterday's preseason game,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Nbd,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Crabtree, Devin Funchess, Stefon Diggs, Sterling Shepard",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Is Jeremy Hill injured?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,No he had a touchdown as well,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"If Jeremy Hill's healthy, I don't want either of them.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"I thought about Gio, but the guys that made my list are clear cut starters.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Ha gio is going to be a monster this year. How many targets are out there after losing Jones and Sanu and no eifert. I'm thinking prolly around 200,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Gio is going to have 80 targets this year,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,So he's a 9 point guy instead of 6.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Not interested.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Well in 1 and a half quarters yesterday he scored 12 but okay,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Your math seems a little off,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,You just gotta hope one of them gets hurt.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Then you'll have an RB1.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"also, the comment earlier about the value's only being starters, i think the rate of injury in the NFL is only increasing. I think every team will have one RB and one WR who will be injured at all times so depth is going to be really important",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,a lot of these value guys are going to find themselves in circumstances of a solid starter,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I agree. Good to have catching rbs on your bench!,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Yeah but guessing their value now is purely guessing.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Alf could be a top 5 RB by week 3 if Zeke gets hurt.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I also can't wait until Henry gets the starting job and gets rookie of the year,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,And therefore be the steal of the draft.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"well yeah, handcuffs aren't value, they're just insurance",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Yeah Henry's a great flier,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,But you can't put him on the value list yet.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I mean he looks amazing. He will get carries week one,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,That is some sort of value,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,For my list I went with guys that are starters and went for significantly less than  other players in their tier.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,I can buy into that,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"right, like a WR2 going for WR3 money etc",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"or two WR3s going for the same price, but one has upside of a WR2 makes them a better value",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Exactly. Like I don't love Andy Dalton, but he went for 3 times less than the other guys with similar projections.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Dalton was a great value but they are limited in their passing game this year,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,They are going to run the ball a ton,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"Andy Dalton also tends to suck when his team is behind, which will prob be the case for most of this season",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Krista Gunter,I'm going to make a top 10 value list based on who has the best throwback jerseys,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Brb,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,but I think QBs in general are going to be the most valueable position this year in terms of generating more points per position than your opponent if we assume it's going to be 2QBs every lineup,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Haha guys, Cincinnati was 12-4 last yeah. I don't think they're going to be losing most of the time this year because they lost Mohammed Sanu.",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,I'm thinking about starting Edelman over Flacco.....,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Too crazy?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"i mean, obviously i'm biased because it was part of my drafting strategy, but a QB1 vs a WR4 or RB3 is no contest - so i think putting the money of Edelman into a better QB2 would have gotten you better overall value assuming you weren't hurting to get a third wide receiver for the minimum lineup",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Well yeah, but shit happens",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Like your QB2 has a bye, so you have to start whacko Flacco",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,But you have a dope ass receiver you could also start,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,QBs floors are definitely higher,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"oh yeah, you're good, J. Flacco is your QB3",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I think it's gonna get interesting when QBs have byes,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"i thought he was your QB2, in which case it would suck to have to decide between a weak QB2 and a WR/RB for your flex each week",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Hahaha yeah dude my life's gonna suck for the next 4 weeks.,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Thanks Bry,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"lol yeah, the hard part for you too is that Edelman doens't really come online lke you want him to until you get Tom Brady back, so Edelman will probably never provide relief in your superflex position",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"Thing about qb is it was so deep this year, and there is not a huge difference been the qbs ranked 5-15th",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Haha with Brees ranked at #5?,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,"Bry, you mad bro?",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"lol, no because i don't believe that they're all in the same tier",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i think it's very deep at QB for 1 QB leagues,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"but in a QB/RB/WR/TE superflex league, QBs and RBs are the highest priority in the beginning of the draft due to the much higher depth at WRs",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,obviously there are a ton of different strategies that can all work even if they're seemingly opposite,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"Yeah I don't agree with that, qb as a position is deep whether or not there are 2 spots in lineup",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,and generally the contrarian draft strategy is the best,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Still think wr is too priority,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Obviously I think that based on my draft :),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"how deep a position is necessarily depends on how many slots there are for that position on the roster. If there were a single RB slot, RBs would be super deep",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,But it is true with 2 qb spots that means more opportunity to capitalize on a point margin,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Yeah that is true,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,I made a judgement that I could probably get 2 decent qbs for cheap given how many decent qbs there are,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"of course, we've also changed the point scoring system to make QBs not as value in comparison to RBs/WRs, so we'll see how it plays out",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,That is not the case with rb,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"At the end of the day we all invested our dollars in various vehicles for points, and I paid a price for spending all my dollars early",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"So, we'll see...",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"lol yeah Dunc, you seemed like you were on a mission to make everyone pay ""market price"" for players",Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Gotta make people pay :),Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Your right Mark good teams usually have leads and what do you do when you have the lead. You run the ball,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Also A.J. tweaked his knee in yesterday's preseason game,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,Duncan Bell,Uh oh,Text,,,,
,8/29/2016,,,David Casstevens,Dunc you were for real,Text,,,,

,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Benjamin Watson?,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,Yeah bry,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Ok so now that we've deciphered this cryptic message,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Kelvin Benjamin and Marvin jones for Matt forte,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Is that right,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,I think it depends on what the rest of your team is,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"if you have tons of WRs and Kelvin Benjamin is a WR3/Flex for you, then it's good",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,if you have Matt Forte and have antoher really strong RB2 option and are hurting for a WR2/3 it would be a good trade for you,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,"It would leave me with green, dt, Edelman.",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,No bench tho,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i think there are plenty of WRs you can pull of waivers for bye weeks,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,that's a good crew still,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,what's your RB situation?,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,"Lacy, Langford for now, leveon waiting on the bench",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,and would you start Matt Forte over Lacy?,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,once leveon is back?,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,We have two flex. One w/te and one wr/rb/te,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,Play both,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"ooh, that's pretty nice - starting LeVeon, Lacy, and Forte",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,I think I would do the trade,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,Melvin Gordon could be flukey - and they have less passing game now that Allen is out,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,i would definitely do the trade if your in a PPR or .5 PPR league,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,Also have fleener and barnidge so if they stop sucking I could put both in,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Ben Deane,It's standard,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"I have barnidge, and the RG3 injury is going to be really good for him",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,he finished last season as TE2 overall,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"i think the trade helps you long term, and especially helps you short-term until you get leveon back",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Bryan Lee,"but this is Just My Opinion, what do others think?",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,Took the words right out of my mouth Bry,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Patrick Deane,I wouldn't do it,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Patrick Deane,"I think forte is risky, so is DT - I think you're much stronger at RB than you are at WR",Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Patrick Deane,I dunno though it's close,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Krista Gunter,I think Forte is great Ben and your RB core will be stacked with him in it,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Mark Casstevens,Sounds like this dude is trying to sell high on Forte.,Text,,,,
,9/13/2016,,,Scott Gunter,"I also have a ""friend""....that is looking for WR1s",Text,,,,

,10/13/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"Welp, 91 comments.  But anyhoo, Pat I severely disagree...  focusing on ""they let you do it"" when you're a star - that flies directly in the face of the national conversation around rape culture that has been going on.  He in that audio tape is embodying the very element in our society which allows for women to be mistreated, as they are",Text,,,,
,10/13/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"While what he literally says does not mean he committed assault, it is clear from his attitude that he would be able to do such a thing, regardless of what the woman thinks/wants.",Text,,,,
,10/13/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"They let you do it therefore not assault.  I'm sorry but come on; that is so weak.  First of all it's coming from trump, so we are getting his perspective only.  Just this week we are having women come forward to say that trump touched them.  But even that aside, you don't think he has taken advantage of being the largest man in the room to take liberties?",Text,,,,
,10/13/2016,,,Duncan Bell,"Anyway while the specific comments do not necessarily render him unfit for the office, when we take it all together it is so evidently clear that he does not belong.  The real amazing thing here is certainly not the focus of the media (it was the same with bill Clinton) - it is that we are in this place at all.  It's absolutely absurd.",Text,,,,

,7/10/2018,22:05:01,14344222842,Luke Wray,"2 defenses suck, shame on yall",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:05:53,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Agreed. We should do 2 kickers as well,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:06:31,14344222842,Luke Wray,"Fuck it, let's do defensive players",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:06:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We can def do all those things,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I hope we’re only doing IR if you drafted that player,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And No to Turnover on Downs getting 2 points???,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:07:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That makes no sense to me,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:08:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It is more difficult and usually better for your team than an INT,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:12:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My feeling on 2 defenses is, currently it's an undervalued position.  It's cheap, it's low priority",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:12:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"If everyone has 2, the pool of valuable defenses becomes more relevant",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:13:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,I would do one defensive player over two defenses,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:13:13,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Which is more analogous to the value of the defense in real football,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:14:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah I agree with Dunc. I’m down to do players over team, but it would have to be 2 players.",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:14:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Dunc or Dave,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:19:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think you meant Dave,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:20:57,84986222184,David Casstevens,My own fucking blood,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:21:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Unbelievable,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:21:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha no I meant Dunc about the value of defenses.,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:24:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, I’m down to do players over teams but we would run into the value problem again if we only do 1",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:26:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Also me right now come on guys 2018_07_10_222639_3AC4E20A422F749FC287.jpeg,image,2018_07_10_222639_3AC4E20A422F749FC287.jpeg,,,
,7/10/2018,22:27:39,14344222842,Luke Wray,I was actually kidding about doing defensive players guys,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:27:58,14344222842,Luke Wray,Like I was trying to be sarcastic,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:28:07,14344222842,Luke Wray,#fail,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:29:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,HH,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:29:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Haha,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:30:17,14344222842,Luke Wray,Something has to be said to keeping the league simple and fun,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:30:49,14344222842,Luke Wray,Like I feel we took a good board game and made it risk,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:35:22,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I don't think it will be very different from last year.  Except now defenses will go earlier in the draft, which I think is cool",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:37:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I don’t like how you can always stream defenses,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:53:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But we might need a roster spot...,,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:54:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"The roster spots are already fixed, why is everyone trippin",,,,,
,7/10/2018,22:56:08,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Do we still want to keep 6 bench spots, or drop one of those now that we’re adding a extra defense and IR spot",,,,,
7/11/2018,7/11/2018,0:28:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I vote keep 6 bench spots,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:37:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah keep 6,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:37:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But now streaming defenses will be less of a thing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:38:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which means that you’ll want to keep 3 defenses for bye weeks/matchups,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:38:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’ll lose a roster spot to a defense theoretically,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:42:32,14344222842,Luke Wray,That's why I say another roster spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:43:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I wouldn’t be against, depending on how the IR spot works",,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:44:40,14344222842,Luke Wray,Let's be honest the ir spot was created out of sympathy for ben lmao,,,,,
,7/11/2018,7:45:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Haha,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Hahaha Luke,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ben is gonna need more than one IR spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:21:49,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,#BIIP,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:01,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Ben's Island of Injured Players,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:22:30,18048190003,Krista Gunter,That should be a shirt with his IR players faces on it,,,,,
,7/11/2018,8:24:37,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Just a wasteland of torn ligaments, broken bones, and lacerated kidneys.",,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:48:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m with Luke here guys,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:04,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The one that will change things the most is the 6 point ts throwing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That’s a baaaaaad change IMO,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rodgers is now the #1 pick,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:49:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Then Brady,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:50:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Screws up the whole auction now,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:50:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Just my opinion,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:51:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Who’s the two most valuable players in real football?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:51:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Rodgers and Brady,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:54:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What do you think about defenses Scotty?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:55:38,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Will make defenses less valuable imo,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:55:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It dilutes a high week scoring,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:57:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I really don’t like how we are wording rule changes without truly explaining them out,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:57:21,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Like this IR spot or extra def,,,,,
,7/11/2018,10:58:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Like the rule wasn’t to add an extra spot AND an extra def,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:08:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Scott if you had a problem with the wording you should have said something before I made the survey,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:08:56,18048190003,Krista Gunter,All of this could have been discussed in the thread before I sent it out,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:09:29,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Also why can’t we add both? If yahoo allows it then why not,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:10:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc that’s not what we voted on,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:10:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,We voted on adding a def...fine we add one,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But don’t change what we voted on by adding another spot too,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,If that’s what people wanted then the wording should have been “add a second def AND a roster spot”,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:11:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I didn’t want any of it that’s why I said nothing,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:12:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"If You really wanted both, then that’s what your wording should have been",,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:11,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ok fuck me then,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Sorry guys...I’m just salty,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:13:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Hate rule changes every year,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:14:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m like 1 rule change away from jumping ship,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:14:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah we haven’t voted on an extra spot,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:16:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"And like if it’s 5/5, there’s no “revote”...it didn’t pass...you can’t just revote over and over to get what u guys want",,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:16:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Agree Scott - 5/5 is no pass,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Respect,,,Agree Scott - 5/5 is no pass,7/11/2018,11:16:59
,7/11/2018,11:18:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I spend one dinner with pat and he’s got my back again,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Even though you KNOW I was trying to increase that buy in!,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:18:48,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,If that passed I woulda voted for a buy in of $100.01,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No Scotty you’re right on all your points - can’t change wording after we voted and the rule is majority to pass,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:19:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,lol,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:21:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott the throwing TD worth 6 is to make running QBs not comparatively too strong,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,True but not really...like cam newton had only what 8 running tds last year?,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:07,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So +16 value,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The value is in the running yards for running qbs,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:27:59,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But I hear what ur saying,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m just saying it throws the draft picks off like whoa,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But people just need to adjust I guess,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rodgers and Brady are by farrrr the #1/2 picks now,,,,,
,7/11/2018,11:28:54,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Not even close,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:02:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah we need to vote on an extra roster spot and I guess we also need to vote on if IR can only be used on drafted players or any players.,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:04:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"The wording has been good so far, we just have a couple more things to vote on",,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:28:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Wrt the drafting....be clear on if YOU have to draft or if you acquire a drafted player through a trade,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:46:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Can we change the yards needed for a point just for QBs?  If so, I’d like to propose an increase",,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:46:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,To 10 at least,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:47:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or 12,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:50:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Rush yards needed for a point that is,,,,,
,7/11/2018,12:52:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Wtf...Federer lost?!?!?!,,,,,

,7/30/2018,15:54:01,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And honestly this would happen maybe once or twice during the whole draft,,,,,

This would help to reduce the length of the draft, however, to Mark’s point the draft is a very enjoyable experience so I would be ok with either change.",,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:40:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Except what we were talking about was allowing nominations only AFTER the first 50,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:40:56,12026045322,Ben Deane,Missed that,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:41:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,Cause people would be trying to get players for 2 because they had money left,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:41:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Mark’s idea of 10 seconds per nomination is a great one,,,,,

,7/30/2018,17:41:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah there has to be a time limit on nominations,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:42:00,12026045322,Ben Deane,Even tho I tilt like crazy so would for sure try to buy players for way too much,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:42:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,We’ve already been doing nominations at the end of drafts for years,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But it’s been after the top 100,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah after first 100,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Exactly,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:43:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Noms are super fun,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:44:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I do think that allowing it right at the beginning before the market is set and everyone has full stacks increases the skill gap,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:44:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So would shoot for after top 30-50,,,,,
,7/30/2018,17:45:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It might speed up the draft because people can pick out their boys then go to bed,,,,,

,7/30/2018,18:32:24,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I'd prefer to change the nominations cutoff to 75, not 50.  I think it's too big of a change, should ease into it",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:32:44,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That seems about right when people start to lose interest in the list players anyway,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:33:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We definitely need to understand how the ir spot will function.  Need to make sure it's playing nice with the additional roster spot via 2nd defense,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:33:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Changing from 100 to 75 doesn't seem like a big enough change,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:36:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Did we say we now have 10 starters, 6 bench spots and an IR spot?",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:41:48,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Im not sure that was explicitly decided yet,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:44:18,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That would be keeping the number of bench spots the same as current,,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:44:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"So, could be difficult.  Then again, maybe too generous to give 7 bench spots AND an IR spot",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:57:19,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Based on the first vote, we would just be adding the IR spot and 2nd defense to the roster",,,,,
,7/30/2018,18:57:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Not changing the bench spots,,,,,
,7/30/2018,19:00:34,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Once the player comes off IR, you’d need to drop a player from your bench to put them back on your roster",,,,,
,7/30/2018,19:00:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Right.  But i think it could be a mistake for us to consider rule changes individually, and not consider the collective impact of multiple rule changes",,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:04:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I agree,,,,,
,7/30/2018,19:04:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,The IR spot is pretty cool so I don't really want to get rid of that,,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:12:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,so maybe I convinced myself that we're ok with bench of 6 and 1 IR spot w 10 starters.  Will ultimately depend on the utility of the IR spot,,,,,
,7/30/2018,19:15:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,2018_07_30_191509_3AE9BD7DE1244F55FF1B.opus,recorded audio,2018_07_30_191509_3AE9BD7DE1244F55FF1B.opus,,,
,7/30/2018,19:15:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So I think it's more like an emergency bench spot as opposed to half a bench spot,,,,,
,7/30/2018,19:16:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Most of the league probably won't use it,,,,,

,7/30/2018,19:27:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And you're right that it also could keep things more active and interesting,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:23:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It will definitely decrease bench spots - people will for sure want to hold 3 defenses,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:23:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,At least for some weeks,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:24:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"If you have a top 10 defense, you’re not going to drop them when you have a bye",,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:24:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or when they okay the Pats,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:24:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Adding a defense I think decreases bench space by about .75,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:25:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think 3/4 of the time people in the league will want a third defense,,,,,
,7/30/2018,22:26:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Having a shorter bench is a good catch-up mechanism: it’s better for the weaker teams,,,,,
,7/30/2018,23:16:34,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I played majority of last season with only 1 defense, streaming the whole way",,,,,
,7/30/2018,23:17:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,People could definitely do that with 2 defenses.  But maybe with our rule changes defenses are also more valuable,,,,,

7/31/2018,7/31/2018,7:38:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc the whole point of 2 defenses is to stop people from streaming,,,,,
,7/31/2018,7:38:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"You will be able to stream a lot less when there are only, at best, 16 defenses available",,,,,
,7/31/2018,7:39:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Same thing happened with QBs when we added the second,,,,,
,7/31/2018,8:34:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think i was the only one streaming last season so I was able to do it pretty well. Took advantage of the waiver wire deadline.  But yeah the pool of defenses will be very diminished this year by comparison,,,,,
,7/31/2018,8:39:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I don’t think I’ve ever held 2 defenses at a time, unless I was approaching a bye week",,,,,

,8/2/2018,10:38:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m also not sure if we are revisiting the vote on QB throwing TD to 6 points since there was a large majority yes vote on that.,,,,,
,8/2/2018,10:39:34,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I feel like the buy-in should at least stay consistent with the rate of inflation.,,,,,

,8/2/2018,10:42:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What* happened,,,,,

,8/2/2018,11:56:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we should include all the questions we voted on + the new proposals and we vote/revote on everything,,,,,

,8/2/2018,12:11:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And changing running yards needed for a point for QBs to 12,,,,,

,8/2/2018,17:00:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What is argument for changing qb running yards points?,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:01:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Makes running quarterbacks less valuable than pocket quarterbacks,,,,,
,8/2/2018,17:05:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat wants to keep passing TDs at 4 points and changing rushing yards for QBs,,,,,

8/3/2018,8/3/2018,7:18:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My problem with that is that the super flex will always and only be a QB,,,,,
,8/3/2018,7:19:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,They’ll score higher and you won’t ever put an RB or WR in that slot,,,,,
,8/3/2018,10:12:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Regarding nominations, I think it just feels early to me at 50.  Everyone has an average of 5 players at that point.  Draft is already a very hectic environment and this introduces some more unpredictability",,,,,

,8/7/2018,17:27:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So here’s my one beef tho,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:28:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Why did we revote on the increasing of the buy in?  It was 5-5 originally and didn’t pass.  I get the ones that needed more clarity, but I feel like this was just a revote to get it passed after someone changed their mind",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:28:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Na’a mean?,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:30:31,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol I think it was def dunc who changed his mind,,,Wow buy in passed.  Someone changed their vote,8/7/2018,17:13:51
,8/7/2018,17:30:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think we should absolutely allow revotes for proposals which were initially 5-5.  That's the whole point of having this period of diwcussion, for people to share their perspectives and be concinced, or not.",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:31:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Imma filibuster the buy in thing.  I’d like to send out a survey to increase to $101,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:32:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What's your argument?,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:32:54,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Argument for $101?,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:33:36,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"It’ll take all the fucks a week to vote on it, then I’ll revote for $102",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:33:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,😉,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:33:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Filibuster baby,,,,,

,8/7/2018,17:34:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Down,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:34:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m happy to keep voting on stuff,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:34:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Down,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:34:54,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I love to vote,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:35:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Imma do my survey in here,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:36:10,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m getting the feeling Scott did not vote for “I love you guys and football” and the end,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:36:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Since we are increasing the buy in, we need to determine what value.  I propose $101.  Please reply yes or imma faggot and want to send more money",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:36:25,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yes,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:37:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,We just need nine more responses until we move onto the next vote,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:37:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:37:23,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Scott do you dispute that by keeping buy in the same, we are paying less each year?",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:38:28,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This is not a valid response to the survey,,,No,8/7/2018,17:37:22
,8/7/2018,17:39:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yes it is,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:39:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So that’s two yes’ at $101,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:40:26,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Can we have a survey within a survey?,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:41:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Disappointed that the QB rules didn’t pass,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:41:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I think no change is better than 6 points per TD,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:41:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Once we finish this survey, we can open that up for discussion",,,Can we have a survey within a survey?,8/7/2018,17:40:26
,8/7/2018,17:42:07,15408158419,Scott Gunter,💯,,,But I think no change is better than 6 points per TD,8/7/2018,17:41:48
,8/7/2018,17:42:38,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Agree,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:43:39,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Using historical inflation trends, it seems likely that $101 this year is worth less than $100 last year",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:45:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Non-precise* historical...,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:45:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,😉,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:45:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also remember to bring ur money or send ur money prior to the draft,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we go with 125,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:06,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"You don’t pay, you don’t draft",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:46:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m guessing everyone who voted not to change will always vote lowest,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:47:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So 125 seems appropriate,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:47:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott I will give you $25 if you stop being a homo on the chat,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:58:26,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is there a option for like $115?  How much inflation are we talking  about per year since we started $100?  When we went from 8-10 ppl? So like 5 years?,,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:59:00,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I'm working on updating fantasy composite scores this week, should be done in a few days",,,,,
,8/7/2018,17:59:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah I mean I think we go with a round number like 125, as it will probably stay for at least a couple years",,,,,
,8/7/2018,18:01:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"For the record I don't want to be one of those leagues that have huge buy in, ever.  Just seems like it should be higher since we're adults now.  Inflation is convenient rhetoric",,,,,
,8/7/2018,18:01:54,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"If we’re doing like $5 increases every year, then $125 to catch up for the last 5 years sounds fair",,,,,
,8/7/2018,18:04:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,<3,,,Scott I will give you $25 if you stop being a homo on the chat,8/7/2018,17:47:42

,8/11/2018,23:33:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also draft efficiency shouldn’t count towards rankings,,,,,

,8/11/2018,23:58:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But you didn't do the best necessarily,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But at least a + composite score,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Objectively I did the best,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:58:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,It depends on how we are weighting the metrics,,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:59:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Also, you already had a high score from last year.  It's hard to improve upon a good score",,,,,
,8/11/2018,23:59:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,You went down in some other categories,,,,,
8/12/2018,8/12/2018,0:00:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s what I’m saying... testing the system to weight the metrics means taking things that are true (me doing the best last season) and comparing against outcomes of the system,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:00:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You had a better score than me last season but had no problem getting more so that argument doesn’t hold,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:00:59,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I am hesitant to alter the weights after using the same weights two years in a row, but it's possible to play around with those",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:01:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dude you’re not addressing my main point,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:01:18,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"The main thing is the points, which I feel is the most indicative thing for fantasy success",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:02:23,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Something I'm toying with though is weighting more recent seasons more than old seasons,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:02:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Because people will be weighed down by the past, plus no one can remember.  Still that is dangerous because it defeats the purpose to an extent",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:03:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Do you agree with my main point?,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:03:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"You think regular season champ, most wins and league winner should lose composite points?",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Regular season champ isnt considered, but avg win ratio is",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Omg you’re missing my point,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:44,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"No I've got you pat, I understand",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:04:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Stop telling me about how the system is built,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:05:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And answer my question on whether you think the a system that leads to that outcome is designed correctly,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:06:08,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"That you lost points from a successful season is probably indicative that the weights need to be changed, yes",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:06:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Agreed :),,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:07:40,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But if you look at the math, it will make more sense.  The graph which shows you losing points is shocking but doesn't show the full picture.  That's why I tried to be transparent",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:08:10,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There's also value in consistency with the weights, having been doing this for 3 years now and not changing them",,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:08:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But ill take a look at it,,,,,
,8/12/2018,0:08:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I still think that points for should be weighed the highest, by far, and we change that at our peril",,,,,

,8/12/2018,1:39:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,That was a long conversation,,,,,
,8/12/2018,7:36:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,Yeah m still in last?!?!,,,,,
,8/12/2018,7:36:25,12026045322,Ben Deane,Wtf!,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:15:04,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Ben the trouble with you is you're weighed down by your previous seasons,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:15:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Your record is: 10th, 7th, 10th, 2nd",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:16:38,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"It'll take time to come back, but good news is having fewer seasons means each season has more impact on your score going forward than, for example, one of my seasons",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:16:58,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Pat I realized something last night, the main reason your score did not increase",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:17:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Its because last year you already had the maximum score for the most important metric, points for",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:18:16,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"So to the extent that you performed above average in points, this year you received no additional credit as you were already receiving the maximum",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:18:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Still going to take a look at the weights but wanted to mention that,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Makes sense,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You see my argument on draft efficiency?,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:19:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Cool thing to track but shouldn’t be part of composite score,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:22:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'm in favor of keeping it in some capacity because it adds texture,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:23:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"It's true that if you draft well then probably you will score many points, will do well in the season, so there is overlap",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:23:44,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But same is true for points, Win percentage, and top 3 finish",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:24:29,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Trade efficiency is a good idea.  But I don't think I can get data on performance of players mid season after a trade occurs,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:24:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Yeah but whereas if you don’t daft well you can still do well, the same is not true of the others",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:25:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"One thought I had was, you could compare an owners end of season roster to their draft roster, and consider only players who are in the delta",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:26:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Have to see if Yahoo still retains that data, and for how many seasons",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:26:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t think either should be included,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:27:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t see a good argument for including,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:27:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Adding texture isn’t valid,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:28:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Well, drafting is such an enormous part of a successful season",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:28:28,12406785346,Duncan Bell,And the players you add during the season is one of the main ways you manage your team's success,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:29:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Texture because obviously the composite score is based on a false premise, the only thing that really matters is the points for",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:29:34,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But it's not very much fun to take the average of that and call it a day,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:29:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I don’t think it is,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:30:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Points for is a forward metric, you could make a case for the only thing that matters is money made",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:30:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I could score 300, 100, 300, 100",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:30:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Not as good as 180 every week,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like your season last year,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I was the better fantasy player even though you scored more points,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Because all your points came in the first half of the season,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:31:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,True but by averaging all seasons ever that would average out,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Anyway that's true and why we consider things like top 3 finish and rank,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Exactly,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Money is the same as top 3 finish,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Valid reasons for including those stats,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:32:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which is why they’re in there,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:33:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So +1 to point I was making,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:33:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Pat you're annoying to argue with,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:34:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2018_08_12_083457_3AD45225090ACB7C3B7B.opus,recorded audio,2018_08_12_083457_3AD45225090ACB7C3B7B.opus,,,
,8/12/2018,8:37:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"That's fair, we are weighting the drafting process too much relative to in-season player acquisition",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:37:48,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think my idea on looking at the end year roster is a pretty good approach for capturing data on those mid season pickups,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:37:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'll need to check the viability,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:39:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But the other thing about the draft draft metric that you didn't mention, and I think is important, is that you score well if you are efficient with draft dollars.  I'm considering the player and how they ultimately performed but also how you used your draft momneg",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:39:40,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"This is an important way we play the game, and not covered by any other metric",,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:41:06,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I think money loss efficiency should also be considered. Trying to give my stats a boost.,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:41:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Haha kj you are essentially funding all of this,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:42:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Wow I’m terrible. Can I change my vote on raising the buyin?,,,"Your record is: 10th, 7th, 10th, 2nd",8/12/2018,8:15:25
,8/12/2018,8:42:57,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. And now you guys want to raise the buy in so I can fund your little winners circle club. Lol,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:43:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott talked me and Dunc in a limited buy-in raise,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:43:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,How about we do $110?,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:44:06,19176901767,Patrick Deane,$10 raise seems fair,,,,,
,8/12/2018,8:45:01,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I'm cool with that,,,,,
,8/12/2018,9:09:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And we said $10 per year for the next 3,,,,,
,8/12/2018,9:10:45,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I look forward to contributing $360 to winners over the next 3 years.,,,,,

,8/12/2018,22:24:09,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Ben to answer your question, that graph is showing the current composite scores, it's called 2017 because it's incorporating the 2017 season.  A little unclear sorry",,,,,
,8/12/2018,22:31:07,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Jesus not again 2018_08_12_223107_3A078653440173DB6265.jpeg,image,2018_08_12_223107_3A078653440173DB6265.jpeg,,,
8/13/2018,8/13/2018,9:07:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I'm now thinking:\nTake away average rank, replace with weighted average rank\nAdd average (or weighted avg) playoff seed\nAdd mid season player pickups\nOptionally could keep or remove top 3 finish.  It serves as another way to value being in the money and also finishing well, but largely redundant with avg rank",,,,,
,8/13/2018,12:05:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Alright Dunc will listen to all this on my commute home,,,,,
,8/13/2018,17:06:06,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Issue with seed is that it is literally win percent + points.  But something to note is that the win percentage I use for metric is based on regular season only.  Playoff games aren't considered outside of rank, top 3 finish",,,,,
,8/13/2018,18:02:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,❤🖤 is anyone else ready for football or just us? 2018_08_13_180244_3AA90D9F9DC70990B230.mp4,video,2018_08_13_180244_3AA90D9F9DC70990B230.mp4,,,
,8/13/2018,18:27:13,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Super cool.  Can't wait to see what your football room looks like in 30 years, going to be nuts",,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:00:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"@15405565554 just listened to your voicemail - agree with you, and we’re saying the same thing:  MOST of the weight on who is the best should be determined by end of season finish / wins / points for (I argue they’re all basically the same thing)... but a small consideration should be given to 1st place finishes since there is a premium on finishing first",,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:12:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,@12406785346 still listening but wanted to address something:  I don’t think we should have any player metrics because end of year points is not a good representation of how good that player was for you this season,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:15:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Example:  zeke last year.  Finished as an RB2... but that’s only because he was suspended for 6 games.  He was an RB1 for every game he played except for 1.  So should Mark get penalized for that?  Absolutely not - Zeke was a beast when he played and didn’t hurt you when he didn’t because you didn’t start him.  Much better than someone like Frank Gore who got some points every week and finished as an RB2 but you didn’t want to start him ever,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:15:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So anytime anyone gets hurts or suspended it fucks their year-end numbers and that then doesn’t accurately represent the value of that player,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:16:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m going to try to draw out a tree and send it over,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:16:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It will have my proposal for stats and weights,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:18:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s also an argument against draft efficiency,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:54:54,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's true that is a limitation of draft efficiency,,,,,
,8/13/2018,19:55:00,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Please do send over that stuff,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:11:59,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think something else to keep in mind is you should try to think about these things from a macro perspective.  So while it's true that draft efficiency will fuck people at some frequency, statistically it will even out in the aggregate",,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:12:11,12406785346,Duncan Bell,And this way we are still considering that dimension,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:16:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2018_08_13_201627_3AF2D90628718BC341F5.jpeg,image,2018_08_13_201627_3AF2D90628718BC341F5.jpeg,,,
,8/13/2018,20:16:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s what I think,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:16:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also net money won/loss is a great metric since it changes so much every year!,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:16:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s why I bumped it up,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:17:14,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Someone could literally jump like 4 spots in a year which is cool,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:51:54,12406785346,Duncan Bell,This does a better job than the current of weighting the top 3 players than the current,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:53:20,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But it's missing some dimensions.  For one it doesn't do as good of a job differentiating 7th-10th.  Also I do think efficiency of draft dollars is a good opportunity to add dimension,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:54:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I am also pretty strongly opposed to considering money like this.  I'm definitely in favor of weighting 1st-3rd more heavily, and I'm even thinking that we could use the current payouts to inform these relative weights",,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:54:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But I'm very opposed to valuing 7th place finish,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:55:52,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I also don't think it's a good thing to introduce volatility.  These are intended to assess the career work of a fantasy owner.  First place finishers are already getting their just desserts for having won their season,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:57:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think win ratio should be included, we may as well as it's such a fundamental aspect of fantasy",,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:57:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think your weights are a little top heavy,,,,,
,8/13/2018,20:58:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I do want to incorporate playoff wins somehow, thinking about the best way to do that",,,,,
,8/13/2018,21:00:46,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think all of this should be on a separate thread,,,,,
8/14/2018,8/14/2018,8:39:14,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Some interesting things to note: the data I use to calculate points and wins are both based on end of REGULAR season stats.  Neither considers what happens in the playoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:40:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My latest thinking is, we replace avg rank with weighted avg rank, give this a larger weight, maybe 20, and also have a metric which tracks wins of any sort following the end of regular season",,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:40:13,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Even 7th and 9th place,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:47:33,12406785346,Duncan Bell,And I'm also leaning towards not giving credit to byes as a playoff win,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:47:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Point of this metric would be clutch wins when it counts,,,,,
,8/14/2018,8:51:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc wouldn’t money won/loss be a good metric since it can change so much?,,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:07:36,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Money is a pretty good proxy for relative weight of finishing at the top of the league, but I prefer to weight finishes in a more controlled way",,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:08:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,For one thing the fact that buy ins change is an unnecessary and unimportant complication,,,,,
,8/14/2018,10:08:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I also don't think introducing a metric which would make the ranks change a lot each year would be a good thing,,,,,

,8/15/2018,17:02:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,They usually update it one more time before our draft,,,,,

,8/15/2018,17:03:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But it shouldn’t change a ton,,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:53:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Bry and KJ both need to get their asses in gear on the chat,,,,,

,8/16/2018,12:54:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Nobody added more value than Dave pre Vietnam,,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:00:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I would be 1 but I’m not as consistent,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:00:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Both of our #1s aren’t even joining this convo so we might need to re-evaluate,,,,,

,8/16/2018,13:01:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but did Vietnam Dave really add value?,,,,,
,8/16/2018,13:01:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Pre Vietnam Dave would have started a fight over this,,,,,

,8/21/2018,11:55:27,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"We had 1 vote to stay at 100, but that person revoted between the two majority options",,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:55:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Without knowing the tally,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:56:28,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"So the original votes were 5, 4, and 1?",,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:56:42,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:57:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Seems to me like we should go with the original majority then,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:57:53,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I don’t think 5 is majority,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:59:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Agree with kris,,,,,
,8/21/2018,11:59:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also 50 is wayyy to low guys...bigger teams this year AND nominations that low...wow,,,,,

,8/21/2018,12:07:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahahaha,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:24:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Technically 5 is the plurality here,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,5 is not the majority,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t pass,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:25:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This is different because we’re deciding between 2 alternatives,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My feeling is that we either need someone to change their vote or go with a compromise like 60,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,5 is the majority when compared with 4 and 1,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s not,,,,,
,8/21/2018,12:26:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Literally is by definition,,,,,

,8/21/2018,12:28:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That would be considered no change...so 100 is an invalid response,,,,,

,9/11/2018,12:13:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Anyone else think the def scores are a little much?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:15:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,12 out of the top 50 fantasy scorers from any position are defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:15:44,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Haha for the people who spent $1 on defenses, yes.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:16:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Seriously though, this week was very turnover heavy",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:17:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If it’s still like this in week 8, then I would agree",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:18:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Yeah I mean you have OBJ hitting his projected and 12 def score more than him,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:18:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Yeah I guess we'll see how things shake out,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:20:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Honestly I’m okay with that. If Jags defense is amazing and wins the game for their team, they should score a lot of points.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:21:02,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then OBJ doesn’t score and his team loses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:25:04,12026152479,Bryan Lee,but it's all of the defenses popping off,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:25:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like what would you say the avg DEF 1 position should be equivalent to? like a WR2? or WR3?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:26:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,WR1,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:27:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Meaning top 10 receiver, but obviously depending on the year",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:27:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,All position values change from year to year,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:28:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But why fantasy just arbitrarily decided defenses and QBs should have little to no value, I’ll never understand",,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:49:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Did we change the scoring for defenses as we agreed?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:49:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,.5 for punts instead of 1 point for 3 and out?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:51:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I mean some of these defenses definitely won the game for their team,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Both their NFL team and their Fantasy team,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Just checked, I don’t think we’ve done this",,,Did we change the scoring for defenses as we agreed?,9/11/2018,12:49:08
,9/11/2018,12:52:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scotty can you check?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:52:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Krista did the changes,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:53:15,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I got pissed and lost privileges,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:53:23,15408158419,Scott Gunter,😬,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:55:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I checked the defense scoring and we can’t change anything for punts unless it’s yards for returns,,,,,
,9/11/2018,12:55:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s not an option,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:01:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,.5 for punts will give defenses more points than 1 for 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:01:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So defense scoring would have been even higher this week,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:07:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I am out right now, but will double check the scoring when I get home",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:50:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Regardless Marky, that’s what we agreed",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:53:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We agreed on something that someone didn’t double check to make sure it was a changeable rule,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:55:54,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Also we voted yes on turnover on downs to 2 points, isn’t that just a 3 and out anyway?",,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:56:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s a different thing,,,,,
,9/11/2018,13:56:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"If we can’t change it, we can’t change it, but we should check if we can",,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:54:32,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"If we weren't change a rule now, would it retroactively apply on week 1?",,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:54:48,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"If not, I don't think we should change",,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:55:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,*were to,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:55:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We absolutely should change if we can,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:56:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Whether it changes retrospectively or not,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:56:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Hmm,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:57:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also if we can’t change I would argue to get rid of points for 3 and out anyway since that was part of the thing we voted on,,,,,
,9/11/2018,14:57:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Most of the reason I proposed that rule was because points for 3 and out is dumb,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:02:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,3 and outs are big for field position and momentum.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:03:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And they’re not very common,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:03:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Except for the top defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:05:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Which is why I like it, it clearly separates great defenses from the average ones",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:06:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A defensive TD can be fluky. Six 3 and outs is just a dominant defensive performance,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:21:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Alright, we can’t change the half point scoring for punting.  Only thing we can do for punts is change return yards or kickoff/punt return TDs.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:22:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Balls,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:22:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we get rid of points for 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:23:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or reduce to .5,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:23:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Part of the thing we voted on was “instead of points for 3 and outs, .5 points for punts”",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:24:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,We actually can’t do too many changes on defense in Yahoo cause there aren’t a lot of options to go on.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:24:58,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Well the question was “change defensive scoring to be 0.5 for every punt, as opposed to 1 point for a 3 and out”",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:25:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Not “instead of”,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:26:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,We cannot take away both,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:26:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That significantly devalues defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:27:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,My team would have had 10 less points last week without 3 and outs,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,“As opposed to” and “instead of” are exact same thing,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think you’re right Mark,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dammit,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:28:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We should have checked on this before the draft,,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:44:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I don’t know what to say about this.  I made all the changes we voted on, except the punt vote which isn’t an option in Yahoo.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,15:57:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think there would be a huge difference anyway,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:27:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I think we just roll with it as is,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:29:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Agreed,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:30:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But Pat, to get back to the original convo",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:31:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,You don’t care that Bry is salty about defenses going off last week?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:34:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i just think defenses are over-weighted now, especially since there is the most limited selection of defenses out of all positions - so there will be very little turnover of defenses",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:34:56,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"there's no backup defense or anything, just one per team",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"of course it's too early to tell, but if the week 1 trend holds, defenses will prob be going off the boards at ~$35+ next auction based on their value and scarcity",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No I don’t care that Bry is salty,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:36:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The thing with defenses is that 1. It’s hard to predict who will be great defenses,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:22,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so that makes it even more luck-based right?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I suspect defenses will be more volatile than other positions which could be the difference maker,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We cannot know that after week 1,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:37:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2. When it’s all said and done the difference between the defenses is not that big,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:38:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,3. This was a crazy week,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:42:43,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Oh!!!! All y’all salty about rule changes?!?!?!,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What did we actually change?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:10,18048190003,Krista Gunter,This league is so ass backwards sometimes I swear.,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahha,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:46,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"You voted for 2 defenses, but then are salty about the extra weights we voted on for them.",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Added a point for 4th down turnover,,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, 14 of the top 50 scoring players in week 1 were defenses",,,,,
,9/11/2018,17:43:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So it’s not our league,,,,,

,9/11/2018,18:39:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The original question was did our rule changes wildly inflate defensive scoring or was it a crazy week for defense?,,,,,
,9/11/2018,18:39:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,By comparing to a standard league it’s obvious that it was a crazy week for defense in fantasy football,,,,,

,9/11/2018,18:42:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,here are the average scores for week 1 for some of the positions: \n\nDEF 1: 23.1 \nDEF 2: 15.8 \n\nRB 1: 28.2 \nRB 2: 17.5\n\nWR 1: 29.5 \nWR 2: 18.3\n\nQB 1: 26.8 \nQB 2: 14.9,,,,,
,9/11/2018,18:42:25,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But comparing to our old rules, at least we prove that we had no agency",,,,,

,9/12/2018,11:56:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,need a vote,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m fine with it since he hasn’t been picked up already,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:43,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"So, suppose you have a player who is \""Out\"", and is only out for 2 weeks.  You placed him on IR spot.  When do you get to take him out of IR?",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"When we voted on it, it was with the stipulation than the player had to be designated as IR",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:56:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah it’s valid,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:20,84986222184,David Casstevens,we need everyone to vote,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"@Mark, yes since I assumed that was the only option Yahoo allowed the spot to be used for",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:57:47,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I won't use him for 6 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"But after looking through the help section, you can use it for a player being out or PUP",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"But there isn't any restriction to being able to take a player out of your IR spot once placed, right?",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:47,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Like, you could do it any time from Yahoo's perspective",,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:58:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I think if its a player you draft if he gets a multiweek injury you can put him there but can't use him for 6 weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,it's a way to hold on to your studs without sacrificing your season,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:32,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We could institute our own rule that it has to be at least 6 Weeks before you can use that player again,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:35,84986222184,David Casstevens,wasn't that the point,,,,,
,9/12/2018,11:59:44,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So the NFL IR is for 8 games (half the regular season). Which is why I originally proposed 6 games (half our regular season),,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:00:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think ir is 6 weeks mark,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:00:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,almost positive,,,,,

,9/12/2018,12:25:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,shit I don't know,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:26:16,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm glad this happened week 1 though,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:26:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yes, or just agree that David gets Olsen week 8",,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:27:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Same could have applied to Krista last year with DJ,,,,,

,9/12/2018,12:28:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I’m saying you would have been allowed to drop him Week 1 and we all just agree that you get first crack at him 6 weeks later,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:28:41,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Gotcha,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:29:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Instead it fucked up one of your bench spots all last year,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:30:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Seems like we should use the IR spot rather than have to keep track of dropped players,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:30:22,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I suppose its potentially complex either way, depending on what we decide",,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:31:41,84986222184,David Casstevens,could we keep a record on a gmail thread,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:31:45,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'm personally in favor of using the ir spot with Yahoo's rules.  More generous but we do have a slightly smaller bench compared to last year anyway,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:31:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think the list of drafted players that people want to drop for 6 weeks will be a long list,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:31:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,or still too much?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:32:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And it’s only 1 per team, so it’s a max of 10 players",,,,,

,9/12/2018,12:33:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Haha Beads of all the records you keep, this would by far be the easiest",,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:33:36,84986222184,David Casstevens,so I could just leave him there and everyone know I get him week 7 for 0 faab bid. if I don't get him he is up for grabs,,,,,
,9/12/2018,12:33:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I’d be happy to keep track for the league,,,,,

,9/12/2018,13:02:53,12406785346,Duncan Bell,So one potential issue with tracking ourselves is enforcement of player eligibility.  Suppose you have a player who is designated Out but is likely only going to miss a couple weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:03:32,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That is counter to the spirit of what we voted on.  I'm open to being more generous but in that case we may as well use Yahoo's off the shelf rules,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:03:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,I want to give a big shout out to my real niggas from the 202!!! Biggie Ben Deane and  Bryan the Asian assault rifle,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:04:00,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Yeah guys. Looks like we have the IR spot setup. Since Bell is designated as Out, I could move him there. 2018_09_12_130400_FC929186604EAA1FB35BA704C0DD12C7.jpeg",image,2018_09_12_130400_FC929186604EAA1FB35BA704C0DD12C7.jpeg,,,
,9/12/2018,13:04:34,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Or, we do not allow players to be placed on ir unless they either are actually ir, or they pass a smell test that there's some serious injury.  The latter is less than ideal because it introduces some subjectivity",,,,,

,9/12/2018,13:08:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,has to be ruled out by injury,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:08:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Even though that would be a bad idea for kj in the event that Bell comes back after 2 weeks and then can't be played until 6 weeks elapsed,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:09:20,84986222184,David Casstevens,yea that would be bad for you kj,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:09:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Basically, I'm down for Yahoo's rules since that is what I thought we were going with, but I don't fully understand their settings. It sounds like once the player moves out of one of the eligible designations, you cannot make any roster moves until you activate that player and make a space for them.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:09:47,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Correct,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:12,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean I just want to find common ground on the spirit of the rule and the letter,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:13,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Obviously, I am biased with the Bell situation, but if he holds out until week 8-9, that would kinda suck.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:10:19,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Which makes sense, after they are eligible to start IR becomes an extra bench spot",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Isn’t my deal with dez the same issue kJ?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,well it would suck more If you put him in ir and he plays next week. you won't be able to release him for 5 more weeks,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"I guess my question is hypothetically, if I picked up Olsen off waivers, could I stash him on IR. I don't think you should be able to do that.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:11:52,12406785346,Duncan Bell,We had said that IR spot was only available for players you drafted,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think it should be because of injury,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:06,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"I believe Dez is NA, which is not eligible.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:12:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,right,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:14:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But what I’m saying is he is holding out for $$$....sesame issue,,,"I believe Dez is NA, which is not eligible.",9/12/2018,13:12:06
,9/12/2018,13:14:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bottom line is we decided on yahoo rules so there’s really no debate here...no?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:14:59,84986222184,David Casstevens,right I don't think it would be okay for bell either,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:14:59,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,But he is not contracted with a team. Bell is.,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:15:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,it was designed for injury,,,,,

,9/12/2018,13:19:05,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Well I think that is moot anyway. Yahoo rules will not allow Dez to IR.,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:19:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Speaking for myself, I didn't realize that Yahoo's IR spot was also eligible for \""out\"" designations.

,9/12/2018,13:56:17,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Then you can't poach injured players to put in IR,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:56:43,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,And I will accept that Bell cannot got to IR since it is not injury related.,,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:56:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Nope,,,Hahahaha great one Luke,9/12/2018,13:53:15
,9/12/2018,13:59:23,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"I just tested it and I can move Bell seamlessly on and off IR. Essentially, I think Yahoo will not allow a player to stay on IR once they become ineligible.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,13:59:56,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Eg, Yahoo will not let you make roster moves until you activate the IR player.",,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:00:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The vote was to use the IR when designated IR on Yahoo,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:00:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That could easily still apply to us,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:00:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Bell and Olsen and Dez do not fit in that category,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:01:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,And only to players we originally drafted,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:01:49,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Correct,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:02:15,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,That works. It already fits within the confines of what Yahoo is allowing us to do.,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:02:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So Delanie Walker,,,,,

,9/12/2018,14:02:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Correct,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:02:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,yes but Olsen is completely different than bell and dez,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:02:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,but whatever,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:03:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,if Olsen goes on ir I should be the only one to get him and put him there?,,,,,
,9/12/2018,14:04:11,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. I agree with what we voted on. I think we consider going with Yahoos rules next year since that helps you for having a dead roster spot from week to week if a player is Out.,,,,,

,9/13/2018,13:16:50,14344222842,Luke Wray,That is only option,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:17:21,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Option 1: we allow IR spot to behave according to off the shelf rules, meaning it can be used for any player with Out, PUP, or IR designation",,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:18:01,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Option 2: we use Yahoo rules for IR spot but house rule that only eligible players are those who are actually designated IR,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Option 2 is what we voted for,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:22,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I feel like we have to stay with that for this year and revisit it next season,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We’re already using house rules because you can’t put any player on there,,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:19:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Option 3: we have some mix of these.  For example, we could allow for \""Out\"" to be used, but they need to be due to an injury.  And/or, we use a simple list outside of Yahoo to keep track of IR spot players, so we can implement some restriction on how long a player needs to be unavailable",,,,,
,9/13/2018,13:21:20,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"For example, David declares he is using his IR spot on Greg olsen, and so he cannot pick Greg olsen back up until 6 weeks have elapsed.  And no one else can pick him up during that period.",,,,,

,10/10/2018,14:48:04,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You need to drop Crowell and then we might need to set up a new time for anyone to pick him up,,,,,
,10/10/2018,14:48:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Like 5pm tonight or something,,,,,
,10/10/2018,14:55:20,84986222184,David Casstevens,okay,,,,,
,10/10/2018,14:55:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,and I get Henry back?,,,,,

,10/10/2018,15:00:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Or at least that’s what we said last year,,,,,
,10/10/2018,16:03:35,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Or we give people an opportunity and if no one wants him then Dave can take him back,,,,,
,10/10/2018,17:38:50,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Could you just have anyone that wants him pick a number and the winner gets him?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,17:39:27,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I don't want the Crow BTW,,,,,
,10/10/2018,17:42:11,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Yeah that's basically the same as letting someone pick up at a given time,,,,,

,10/10/2018,18:29:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That’s a great question,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:36:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Def don't faab it because he already went to FA,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:38:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If multiple people want him why do we need to play fucking quick draw?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:38:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s the dumbest thing in our league,,,,,

,10/10/2018,18:39:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah someone should have bid $0 FAAB on him,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:39:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I bid $3 on him but I got clement instead,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:39:43,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But now I want him,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What’s the downside of putting him on waivers again?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And bidding?,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And Dave can’t bid,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s the punishment,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think he’ll go straight back to FA,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not waivers,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:40:59,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Because Dave didn’t get him on waivers,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:43:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Yes he goes back to FA unless he drops his tomorrow,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:43:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Then it’s waivers I think,,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:44:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"We can’t do anything with it until he drops him, which he hasn’t done yet",,,,,
,10/10/2018,18:54:21,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. Same day pickup from FA and drop goes back to FA. Otherwise it would be a strategy to lock everyone up in Waivers by doing that.,,,,,
,10/10/2018,19:12:28,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’ve tried to do this before,,,Yeah. Same day pickup from FA and drop goes back to FA. Otherwise it would be a strategy to lock everyone up in Waivers by doing that.,10/10/2018,18:54:21

,10/11/2018,21:06:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,#n00b,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:07:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s a change from last year,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:07:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think we should adjust points next year,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:07:33,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:07:38,12026045322,Ben Deane,Like if you only allow 10 points that’s nasty,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:07:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Y’all are hilarious,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:08:03,12026045322,Ben Deane,You allow 7 points and do nothing else you only score like 5 points,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:08:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If you only allow 7 points, you most likely did other things",,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:08:49,19176901767,Patrick Deane,2 points for a 3 and out is a fucking feeding frenzy,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:08:50,12026045322,Ben Deane,Yeah I get that,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:09:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This is when I wish I had that life replay thing,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:09:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat we couldn’t do points for punts on Yahoo,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:09:44,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Would go back in time for sure,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:09:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So we upped the 3 and outs?,,,Pat we couldn’t do points for punts on Yahoo,10/11/2018,21:09:29
,10/11/2018,21:09:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Which would also have been a feeding frenzy,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:10:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Exactly, it pretty much evened out the punt rule change",,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:10:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Was that a conscious decision?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:10:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I def didn’t vote on that,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:11:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott also I don’t know what you’re yapping on about - I’ve always hated 3 and outs,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:11:57,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So the 3 and out 2 point was there last year,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And that’s a good rule,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You LIKE that rule Scott!?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Just because I don’t?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:34,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,We need to have something that differentiates the #3 defense from the #13 defense,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:38,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m laughing about the fact that we’ve had sooo many rule changes that people forget the rules,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And 3 and outs are the best way to do that,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:12:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yes,,,You LIKE that rule Scott!?,10/11/2018,21:12:24

,10/11/2018,21:13:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc its just like a turnover,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:13:24,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Three and out is when defense has forces a 4th down?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:13:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Same as an interception,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:13:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,....on the first 4 downs of a drive...yes,,,Three and out is when defense has forces a 4th down?,10/11/2018,21:13:24
,10/11/2018,21:14:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s not the same as an interception,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:14:23,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also pat...I’m pretty sure it was ur idea in 2017!!!,,,,,

,10/11/2018,21:15:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It’s exactly the same as a 40 yard INT in the offense’s first 3rd down,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:15:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"You have Philly defense, what are you yapping about",,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:15:07,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pats defense has two 3and outs and now he’s complaining about it,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:15:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Don’t get mad at us for not picking up a def yo,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:15:12,12026045322,Ben Deane,Lol,,,,,

,10/11/2018,21:15:36,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Are we sure about that?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This is about bozo rules,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This calls for a mid season vote,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:28,15408158419,Scott Gunter,No way,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott stop trolling,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha well I mean you have to have an actual argument at least,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:16:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Don’t try to discount defenses bc u don’t have one,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:17:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not just “bozo” rule,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:17:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Scott my season is over,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:17:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pats sitting here like why does my team have so many points- that’s not normal,,,,,

,10/11/2018,21:18:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I honestly don’t think it’s about your team,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I can’t figure out what it’s about,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:13,12026045322,Ben Deane,2018_10_11_211813_3A8A0166299BEFB6E116.jpeg,image,2018_10_11_211813_3A8A0166299BEFB6E116.jpeg,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Do you not like that defense isn’t as much of a crapshoot as it used to be?,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s honestly about 3 and outs being weighted way too much,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s not the same as an interception and we all know it,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:18:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah that makes defense less of a crapshoot,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:19:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,A punt on avg changes field position 43 yards,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:19:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So it’s literally a 43 yard INT,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:19:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I don’t really care about that,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:20:03,12026045322,Ben Deane,Int is 100% better,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:20:07,12026045322,Ben Deane,Can’t argue that,,,,,
,10/11/2018,21:20:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahaha,,,,,

,10/15/2018,23:02:15,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,He already got one. Sucks cause GB didn't convert on 4th down and left SF to start their drive at the one.,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:03:31,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I think our D scoring is too aggressive overall this year.,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:03:59,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,D's can get blown out and still score double digit points,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:05:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,My take is this - even last year we had defenses which scored like crazy and won people weeks,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:05:48,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Bry takes the lead,,,,,
,10/15/2018,23:05:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But it's not fun to win with your defense.  No one is excited about their defense.  So it's annoying when you are losing because of your opponents defense,,,,,

,10/15/2018,23:07:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,That was a huge stop for GB’s defense though,,,,,

,10/26/2018,22:37:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mark,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:37:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,I have to push back a bit,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:38:14,84986222184,David Casstevens,Your call on mahomes is such an easy one,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:41:26,84986222184,David Casstevens,So what your telling me he's not gunna take a run at Peytons SS touchdown record. Because his pace is just under that,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:41:56,84986222184,David Casstevens,That dosebt take a guru at fantasy pros to figure that out,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:42:59,84986222184,David Casstevens,But......... excluding injury he will be a top 5 qb rest of season,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:43:27,84986222184,David Casstevens,My question for you is what does your eye test say about him,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:27,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,My eye test tells me he’s the new Desaun Watson,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,So what does that mean,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:45:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then I looked up the stats and their first 7 NFL games are almost identical,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:46:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I brought him up because ESPN did a segment about how he was the front runner to win the MVP this year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:47:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I think his play will regress as the season goes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:48:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,As defenses get film and the weather gets worse. And they’ve also had all their weapons completely healthy so far,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:49:00,18048190003,Krista Gunter,The fuck is this?,,,My question for you is what does your eye test say about him,10/26/2018,22:43:27
,10/26/2018,22:49:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If Tyreek and Kelce miss games, this offense will look different",,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:49:42,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Top 5 rest of season is close,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:51:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Absolutely if anyone loses their best two receivers they wont be as good But......,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:52:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm gunna give you my scouting report since you are busy and can't divulge,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:56:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Except for the actually great QBs,,,Absolutely if anyone loses their best two receivers they wont be as good But......,10/26/2018,22:51:10
,10/26/2018,22:56:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,Here is what I will say,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:56:49,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I.e. Brady (🐐), Rodgers, Brees",,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,Since cam Newton came out,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mahomes is the best thrower of the football I have seen,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,Like a pitcher he has many different types of throws,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:57:51,84986222184,David Casstevens,Not just a fastball,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:58:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,And brady wasn't great his first year playing,,,,,
,10/26/2018,22:59:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Haha Deion Branch was his top pass catcher,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,He threw for 140 yards in a Superbowl win. He threw like  one touchdown in that playoff run,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:16,84986222184,David Casstevens,He is the goat but he became great,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Rank these young QBs: Luck, Wentz, Watson, Goff, Darnold, Goff",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,Where is mahomes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:37,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Goff on there twice,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:00:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Shit I meant Mahomes instead of a second Goff,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:01:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I obviously love Goff,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:01:13,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So Mahomes is just a Goff’s dobbleganger then,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:02:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mahomes wentz luck watson Goff and I think darnold could be top three in a couple years,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:03:05,84986222184,David Casstevens,Top three of the younger classes,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:05:44,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’m gonna save this text for when mahomes is at the bottom of the QB barrel next year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:02,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yea if he gets injured,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:06,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahaha Dave always likes the shiny new toy,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:06:11,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Dude has played 7 games and he’s the top young QB??,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:08:03,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I’m ranking them Goff, Watson, Wentz, Mahomes, Luck, Darnold",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:08:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Maybe even Luck last because he’s been in the league 6 years already,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:09:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Well I feel like I am pretty good at breaking down talent. If you guys don't see that he has a rocket when he needs it but throws touch passes on the perimeter and can stretch the defense with the biggest arm in the league all to go with being extremely accurate in his basically rookie season......... then I don't know how we can talk about this going forward,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Ok good talk,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:31,84986222184,David Casstevens,I agree,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:39,84986222184,David Casstevens,Love these conversations,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:10:43,84986222184,David Casstevens,Everyone wins,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:11:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I didn’t realize Luck was 6 years in. He’s definitely the best in that group, but that’s really not fair with that much experience",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:12:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think I’ve ever seen a QB start his career with such little coaching and roster talent around him,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:12:38,84986222184,David Casstevens,I can agree he might be the best but I have to go off body of work in his case. I think he could be the best in the league in about three years but he has to stay healthy and they have to get an o line,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And Mahomes has great arm talent, but I’ve seen the 1st QB take the league by storm and then regress back to good or average in the second season",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,1st season* QB,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:42,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yea if they can't sit in the pocket and throw dimes!!!!,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Cam,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:13:50,84986222184,David Casstevens,Mariotta,,,,,

,10/26/2018,23:14:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Kapernick,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:14:51,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yes I get that,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,He isn't that type of player,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:06,84986222184,David Casstevens,He is a thrower,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:11,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Cam, RG3, and Kaep are great examples",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:11,84986222184,David Casstevens,Loves to throw,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Nobody realized they couldn’t get through progressions until year 2,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:47,84986222184,David Casstevens,You think he is like those players,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:15:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Mahomes mostly throws to wide open receivers,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,Dude have you watched these games,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:55,84986222184,David Casstevens,He isn't just a rocket,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:16:59,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think he and Watson are both better throwers than those guys,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,Agree,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But I’m reserving judgement until next year,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:17:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Every QB in the league right now is wishing they were playing in that offense,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Duh. That's why I drafted him. It's nice to have my son on your team,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Watkins is not a #1 option, but he’s a helluva #4 option",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:18:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,Makes you look great,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:19:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,The first game I saw my son I knew he was great. I don't need to wait a year on players if I see it,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:20:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I think if he was on the Jets or Cards, he’d be about QB20",,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:21:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,20 is high but I would say around qb 10-12,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:21:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’ll take that bet that he isn’t top 5 from week 8 through fantasy playoffs,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:22:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Well one he hasn't had his bye,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:22:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,You said this minutes ago,,,But......... excluding injury he will be a top 5 qb rest of season,10/26/2018,22:42:59
,10/26/2018,23:23:15,84986222184,David Casstevens,Okay just to give him his props give me his top score of the year during his bye and you can put that shit on the board,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:23:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’ll give you his bottom score,,,,,
,10/26/2018,23:23:45,84986222184,David Casstevens,Lol,,,,,

,11/20/2018,11:19:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The rule change = fact that last place is given to most points,,,,,

,11/21/2018,10:56:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The MVP conversation is officially over.,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Who should be MVP?,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Zeke, but Amari is making a pretty good case for himself",,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:57:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahaha,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:58:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Honestly I think Brees will win it by a lot,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:58:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:58:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But personally I think Luck is the MVP,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"In the strictest sense of the phrase, you might be right",,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But no ones views it like that,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s more “who’s the best player on a great team”,,,,,
,11/21/2018,10:59:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I wish they would change it to POY,,,,,
,11/21/2018,11:00:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Because then you could get RBs in the conversation too,,,,,
,11/21/2018,11:02:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat who do you think is MVP?,,,,,
,11/21/2018,11:10:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,David,,,,,

,11/21/2018,12:23:59,84986222184,David Casstevens,I think it's luck,,,,,
,11/21/2018,12:24:08,84986222184,David Casstevens,But brees is second,,,,,
,11/21/2018,12:24:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,Brees has elite talent all around him and a offensive guru as a head coach,,,,,
,11/21/2018,12:25:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,Luck is going to need back surgery after the season after carrying this sorry ass team,,,,,

I'm hoping Cook can give me at least 75% of Hunts production. I also need Conner to step back up. He hasnt been giving the Bell like production he was earlier.,,,,,

,1/8/2019,18:00:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,part of what makes Belichick great is that he is a pessimist and always prepares for the worst,,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:00:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"for example, the final goal line defense he ran against seattle in the SB, that stopped Seattle from winning was a defense they ran just that one time, meant specifically for that kind of situation",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:00:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"meant to look like a nickel-like defense, but was in fact a goal line defense",,,,,

,1/8/2019,18:02:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"patriots keep things very simple, they have an archetype of what kind of team they want to create and then focus on a culture of hard work and no ego, i.e. they have an archetype of wanting a very fast and physical team and will draft people only that fit that archetype first and foremost",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:02:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So the browns,,,"also too many NFL organizations try and cherry pick good things from other organizations and end up with a bunch of patchwork pieces that don't really fit together and the organization ends up lacking its own distinct culture and direction, which ultimately leads to a poor organization",1/8/2019,18:01:47
,1/8/2019,18:03:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, he brings up the browns specifically as a dysfunctional organization where the Coach, Owner, and GM don't trust one another and don't give each another enough room to create their own space and culture",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:04:18,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"Lombardi used to have a handful of bad teams he would watch, and if his team and one of these bad teams were both interested in the same player for the draft, he would reconsider and most likely avoid that player",,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:05:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Well run NFL organizations also look a lot like well run startups or businesses,,,,,
,1/8/2019,18:05:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they would run after action reports after every win and loss, and each coach would need to submit what they did well and what they could do better",,,,,

Annnd it was a phantom pass interefence call and an obvious incomplete catch. There were so many more reffing failures that were admitted after that game that sent the Saints to the SB. Bountygate non-withstanding. Fuck Sean Payton. I hope that piece of shit never gets to a SB ever again.,,,,,

,2/19/2019,9:46:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There are a lot of common idioms that have their roots in racism or bigotry.  Like \""jerry-rig\"", it was a term that meant have a black guy do a job ie do it quick and poorly",,,,,

,2/19/2019,9:47:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,To it depends on what you’re referring to as blackface,,,Here’s another question:  how do you feel about all these people getting fucked for racist things (ie black face) when they were young?,2/19/2019,8:56:23
,2/19/2019,9:48:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Blackface 100 years ago when a white guy would do it and dress like a court jester t specifically demean black people is definitely racist,,,,,
,2/19/2019,9:48:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think there is some distinction to be made between people dressing up as a black person for Halloween (eg Michael Jackson) and getting in blackface with someone dressed as kkk,,,,,
,2/19/2019,9:48:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But a guy putting on dark makeup in the 80s as part of a Mr. T costume is different,,,,,

I don’t think blackface for a Halloween costume is considered with racism intent. There are some exceptions, but generally it’s in good nature...I.e. mr t costume in the 80s or Olivia dressing up as Moana",,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:16:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Just my opinion that people are quick to judge people,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:26:31,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Pat and I have talked extensively about this,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:26:46,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I also have a problem with something they do...not their culture,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:27:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m also considering becoming religious-ist towards Muslims... I wasn’t aware of some of the things that Islam promotes,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:27:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And it truly is closed,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:27:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,They literally hate gay people,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:27:49,19176901767,Patrick Deane,How is that ok?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:27:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But the no work Friday after 4 and no working on Saturday is really tough for me to swallow as a tax guy when everyone is working long hours during tax season but they get to leave early every single week,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:28:50,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Pat isn't orthodox Judaism and Christianity similar?,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:37:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And that’s unacceptable,,,,,

,2/19/2019,10:55:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Who favors their agenda,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:55:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Or is an Orthodox Jew themselves,,,,,
,2/19/2019,10:56:03,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah I think that's right, and they can move into a small town and basically become an instant majority voice or at least a plurality",,,,,

,2/19/2019,11:44:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Because I guess the creators thought the only way to explain how everyone is racist and too PC is with puppets,,,,,

,2/19/2019,12:28:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No you’re good Kris,,,,,
,2/19/2019,12:28:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’ll vouch for you,,,,,
,2/19/2019,12:44:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Not yet, but who knows in 10 or 20 years",,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:50:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i'm jumping in late on the previous topics, but i think chink is fairly offensive, but i think the intent behind it matters more than just the word itself",,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:50:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,also think it's fucked up that they prevent more asians from getting into harvard,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:51:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,especially when they say their admissions are merit-based,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:51:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think if they're doing affirmative action for white people they need to come out and own it and have a program,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:52:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or come out and label themselves as a historically white college,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:55:00,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think it's ultimately bad for harvard in the long run too,,,,,
,2/19/2019,13:55:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they get less qualified students, they tarnish their brand of being the best of the best, and other institutions will surpass them",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:02:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"also i think a difference with the orthodox jews and why they act so tribal is partly to do with being a minority that you can easily identify visually, like different races",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,a lot of races that are a minority will stick together especially when moving to a new place,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i.e. chinatowns,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:48,12026045322,Ben Deane,Bryan just dropping truth bombs all over the bitch,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:03:59,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you expect discrimination, so you try and create your own little world where there's no room for it",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:08:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah it’s different with the Orthodox Jews,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:08:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Super true,,,"they get less qualified students, they tarnish their brand of being the best of the best, and other institutions will surpass them",2/19/2019,13:55:37
,2/19/2019,14:09:18,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Although it’s basically affirmative action,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:03,19176901767,Patrick Deane,One benefit of affirmative action is diversity creates a richer environment,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:51,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So according to that argument it would be a detriment to Harvard if it were all Asian,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:10:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which I agree with in principle,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:11:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But there’s so many different dimensions on which to create diversity... people focus too much on race,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:11:44,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah i agree with that too, but how much diversity is required?",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Some, you can’t have just all Asian kids from Northern California",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:09,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like if current affirmative action programs require like 4% black people, then maybe it should be 4% white people too",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:14,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or 4% minimum for all races,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Even if they’re the smartest,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i mean, i think you can",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:38,12026152479,Bryan Lee,they just don't go to harvard,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:12:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m saying Harvard can’t have that,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:13:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"but if they deem like 4% black population as \""diverse enough\"" then shouldn't that level suffice for the white population too?",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Great point,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,or they should just say that they want their school population to represent the generael population of the US in diversity and make it a rule,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:14:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Right... why cap Asians at 60% or whatever,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,They would never cap white people at 60%,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,right,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:15:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Same thing with the schools in NY,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:16:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which are 62% Asian and people are throwing a fit,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:16:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I agree though... caps are dumb,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Some quotas in schools are ok,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like 20% diverse I can see a good argument for,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Not in the workplace though, it’s already too late",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah i think affirmative action has a place,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:17:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:18:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,affirmative action startiiiiiing now in 2019,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:52:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I don’t think race should be on any applications at all,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I totally understand why it was necessary immediately following segregation, but that was generations ago now",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so do you think there should be no minimum amount of diversity?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:53:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think the only affirmative action now should be on a financial basis,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Yeah but you’re only looking at it from a “equality of opportunity” perspective, which might be the most important",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:46,12026152479,Bryan Lee,segregation was just like 2 generations ago and outright racism was just one generation ago and still a part of current generations,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:54:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But there’s also another side of diversity: having a more diverse student body enriched everyone’s experience,,,,,

,2/19/2019,14:55:33,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Financial affirmative action would diversify,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:56:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’d be ok with the entire student body being female?,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:56:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And it would be a more enriching experience than an upper middle class Asian, Black and White students",,,,,

,2/19/2019,14:57:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Would try*,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You’d need a lot of affirmative action,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:49,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Some type of program for retards,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:57:58,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i tend to agree, but there will always be inherent bias by the school administration in charge of filtering students, where I think you need an explicit policy in place to encourage actual diversity, i.e. people casting out \""black\"" sounding last names",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:26,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:58:29,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s the third dimension: biases,,,,,

,2/19/2019,14:59:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"because free markets don't really work, just like how a business can have a monopoly, it's worse for everyone involved",,,,,
,2/19/2019,14:59:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but markets should be as free as possible,,,,,

,2/19/2019,15:00:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i think having all of that identifying info should be removed - i think it's also not diminishing as much as you think it is; we had a diversity hiring consultancy come in and give a talk to our company last year and the simple name change from black/white and name change from male/female made like a 10%+ difference in acceptance rate and salary",,,,,
,2/19/2019,15:06:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Well, male to female is completely understandable",,,,,

,3/15/2019,11:25:50,18048190003,Krista Gunter,That’s the Cleveland I was looking for,,,,,
,3/15/2019,11:28:15,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And the last 5 games of last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,11:29:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So essentially 13 game suspension,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:31:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Rays was much worse for 4 games,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:32:09,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Waaaaaaaay worse,,,,,
,3/15/2019,12:32:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Wonder how bad his other incident was,,,,,

,3/15/2019,12:43:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Something happened at a resort we stayed at over the summer in Ohio and he covered that up too,,,,,
,3/15/2019,13:54:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Why would the Steelers trade Antonio Brown to Oakland for the #66 and #142 picks in the 2019 draft? isn't that a steel? Wouldn't a current top 5 receiver be worth more than a top 5 draft of just the incoming players? let alone #66 and #142?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:00:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah everyone’s first reaction was “isn’t AB worth a lot more than that”,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:00:57,12026045322,Ben Deane,Worst trade ever was Odell,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:05,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s 5 years younger than AB,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,AB is already 30,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But obviously he’s not, the Steelers made it clear he was going to be traded and this is the nest offer they got",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:01:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Best* offer,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:02:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not to mention the freeing of cap space,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:02:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Interesting that the WRs with the biggest contracts got traded pretty quickly after the deal,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:04:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also Dez and Demaryius’ big contracts weren’t great for their teams either,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:05:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Two firsts and a third is about right,,,Worst trade ever was Odell,3/15/2019,14:00:57
,3/15/2019,14:05:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,As well as clearing cap space for a rebuild,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:00,12026045322,Ben Deane,1 first,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:12,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Peppers was a first round pick last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:15,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And can play,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Still,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:37,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think it’s terrible,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:07:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So better than a pick because half of the first rounders can’t play,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:05,12026045322,Ben Deane,If you could draft Odell this year he would go 1st overall,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:15,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s a guaranteed stud,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,Probably the best wr in the league for the next 4 years,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:39,12026045322,Ben Deane,For sure top 5,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:08:59,12026045322,Ben Deane,The cap space makes sense,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:09:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,But shit. They don’t have any other good players. Where is all their cap going?!,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:10:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,If they’re smart they’ll get a QB this year and then go HAM in free agency next offseason like Philly did two years ago and the Rams did last year,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:14:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Also, I’m not sure paying for a QB is the play",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:27,12026045322,Ben Deane,Yeah they have 6 and 17,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:36,12026045322,Ben Deane,Is the OSU guy tight?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Brees and Brady took pay cuts last year. Goff Mahomes Jackson Watson Trubisky and Dak were all on rookie deals,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:15:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Almost all of the playoff teams had cheap QBs,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:16:16,12026045322,Ben Deane,Very lucky that that many young QBs were that good,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:16:40,12026045322,Ben Deane,If you have mahomes you don’t drop him before he gets a big contract hoping to hit again,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:20:16,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I know, you pay him like Rodgers and then watch your team be terrible like GB",,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:20:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then complain that your QB can’t get a defense to help him out,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,So you would get rid of mahomes?,,,,,
,3/15/2019,14:21:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,In a heartbeat,,,,,

,3/21/2019,18:43:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Lol everyone picking Marquette,,,,,
3/24/2019,3/24/2019,9:05:14,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"“The Broncos have proposed a rule that would give teams an alternative option to the onside kick. Instead of trying to recover an onside kick, teams would have the option of attempting to convert a fourth-and-15 play from their own 35-yard line. If they get the 15 yards, they get a first down and keep possession of the ball. If they don't get the 15 yards, the other team would take over possession from wherever the play ended.”",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:05:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Alternative rule change proposal to an onside kick,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:05:31,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Show of hands how fun would this be.,,,,,

,3/24/2019,9:16:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is this what the AAF is doing?,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:17:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Yes but they have a couple of additional requirements for it, but has been successfully done already",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:17:35,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s a rule for American football Dave,,,I'm lost,3/24/2019,9:15:57
,3/24/2019,9:17:42,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You remember how that works right,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:19:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m not convinced the success rate of this would be any higher than the 7% success rate of onside kicks this year though.,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:19:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4th and 15 is pretty easy to defend,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:20:12,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Unless you get a defensive hold then the same rules apply,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:20:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Automatic first down,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:22:55,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm pretty sure it would happen more than 7%,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:23:11,84986222184,David Casstevens,Room converted on half of 3 and 15,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:25:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Would be more than 7% and I’m ok with that,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:32:04,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,From 2006-2012 there were 13 of 72 4th and 10 or more converted,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:32:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,4th and 20 or more was 1 for 21,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:33:26,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Seeing that, 4th and 10 would be better",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:33:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Something that’s closer to 20% would be great,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:35:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,This was the Ray Rice run wasn’t it,,,4th and 20 or more was 1 for 21,3/24/2019,9:32:19
,3/24/2019,9:35:23,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Honestly I’d rather them say the kicking team can line up 8 yards away,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:35:45,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Onside kick is really fun, but 10 yards is too far out",,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Onside kick isn’t fun because you can get a running start,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:24,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Idk if 8 yards instead of 10 is a difference,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:36:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Can’t,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:39:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Well I’m glad they’re looking at it,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:39:51,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,This is the beauty of capitalism.,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:07,84986222184,David Casstevens,Ask greenbay about statistics on onsidekicks,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,NFL stole a bunch of stuff from XFL 20 years ago too,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah maybe make it 4th and 10 but from the 20 or something,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:40:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,#toosoon,,,Ask greenbay about statistics on onsidekicks,3/24/2019,9:40:07
,3/24/2019,9:44:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The other proposal I heard was moving the kickoff up to the 45 yard line,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:45:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So kickoffs end up being touchbacks or really high like punts which the NFL likes better than the traditional kickoff,,,,,
,3/24/2019,9:46:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also onside kicking from your own 45 isn’t as risky if the other team starts with it in their own territory if not successful,,,,,
,3/24/2019,18:05:30,12026045322,Ben Deane,Gronk gone!,,,,,
,3/24/2019,18:07:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is it real though?,,,,,

,6/7/2019,8:09:03,14344222842,Luke Wray,They are playing in some crazy winds. I hated that shit. Windy tennis sucks,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:16:55,14344222842,Luke Wray,Fed with the early break in the second. This looks like its gonna be a good one,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:24:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Why do you think it’s VFI Ben?,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:25:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Cause it’s turned into a huge race thing and I don’t think it was that big of a deal,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:26:04,12026045322,Ben Deane,People calling for the word owner to be taken away from sports owners because they treat their team like slaves,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:26:08,12026045322,Ben Deane,Feels excessive,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:26:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,Also lebrons post feels like too much,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:26:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,Everyone acting like he attacked Lowry and should go to jail,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:26:40,12026045322,Ben Deane,People are huge pussies these days,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:27:57,12026045322,Ben Deane,Also love that if anyone else had said this you would have given your thoughts but since I said it I need to justify,,,,,

,6/7/2019,8:30:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Lebron has always said he eventually wants to be an owner,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:31:17,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s allowed to say owner tho cause he’s black,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:31:37,12026045322,Ben Deane,If the dude who pushed Lowry was black this would be a non issue,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:31:47,12026045322,Ben Deane,And he wouldn’t have gotten a 500k fine,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:32:22,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Giant eye roll,,,People calling for the word owner to be taken away from sports owners because they treat their team like slaves,6/7/2019,8:26:04

,6/7/2019,8:36:34,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Sure, change the word owner. They’ll still be billionaires making all the decisions for the team.",,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:38:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,What I saw was a part owner who had probably been drinking and was salty his team was losing,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:39:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But also, I’ve been saying for years that the fans are too close in basketball",,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:40:08,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,It should be a platform like the Final Four was,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:52:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,Lebrons post also made it worse,,,,,
,6/7/2019,8:52:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,Has 50k comments,,,,,

,6/7/2019,10:22:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,My thoughts is you can’t have fans pushing atheletes,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:23:23,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And you should ask like sitting courtside is a privilege and respect the game and the atheletes,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:23:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But agree that if you’re getting all butt hurt for something he said then you need thicker skin as a public figure and stop being a pussy,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:25:44,84986222184,David Casstevens,This will be awesome to argue about this weekend,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:25:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Lol,,,,,

,6/7/2019,10:28:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah people stopped viewing it as a privilege when they started charging $40,000 for people to sit there",,,And you should ask like sitting courtside is a privilege and respect the game and the atheletes,6/7/2019,10:23:23
,6/7/2019,10:30:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Market forces... if people are paying for it...,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:30:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Then they can do whatever they want,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:00,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also just saw that Warriors fans are talking shit about Drake being on the court,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:34,84986222184,David Casstevens,Omg,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:32:47,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Saying this is what happens when they let Drake do that,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:33:07,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I can’t believe this is news a story,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,Pile on culture,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:34,84986222184,David Casstevens,#Americanculture,,,,,
,6/7/2019,10:41:40,84986222184,David Casstevens,Fake outrage,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:16:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"The thing is the guy was also a part-owner of the Warriors, so you have to set yourself to a higher standard if you're representing the Warriors organization at that level",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:20:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I definitely agree with that,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:21:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Normal fan, ejection would have been the appropriate punishment",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:21:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"right, but this guy was too high profile",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:22:14,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"So for part-owner to get ejection, 500k fine and 1 year ban is pretty steep",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:22:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But appropriate since he’s held to a higher standard,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:23:00,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think you have to make it steep - you have to make the punishment much worse than the \""crime\""",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:23:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"otherwise, let's just say it's ejection and 100k fine - people with courtside seats could shove someone every game of every season and it wouldn't dent their wallets",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:24:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not if the court was on a platform,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:24:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But then they couldn’t charge as much for seats,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:08,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i could also see the \""normal\"" fan coming on court and shoving a player getting a lifetime ban",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:21,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like you can't have fans jumping into the court and only getting ejected,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:25:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Drake came into the court.....,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:26:03,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, wonder why basketball is the only sport to have the seats so freaking close to the court, to the point where it hinders the players from playing",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:26:26,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"he wasn't \""normal\"" though and he didn't \""physically assault\"" anyone",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:27:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Hahahahaha,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,drake also is a golden state fanboy,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,he has a tattoo of curry and KDs numbers on  his arm,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:21,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I appreciate you putting physically assault in quotations,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,lol,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I honestly like Drake and Spike Lee doing that stuff,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:28:59,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah it would be interesting what would have happened to drake if he shoved one of the players,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:29:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"but the drake thing also has a different flavor to it, because its two dudes getting in each other's faces and talking smack",,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:29:40,12026152479,Bryan Lee,versus some rich part-owner shoving a player when they don't see it coming,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:34:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I love that it is,,,,,
,6/7/2019,11:34:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s not quite as good as the MaGA hat kids in DC but it’s good,,,,,

,7/19/2019,15:07:10,12026045322,Ben Deane,We’re gonna fire him. Union will threaten to sue us and we will just take him back. Not sure where the liability lies with it. I assume not on us. And yes they can and do coordinate it,,,,,

I immediately turned to Krista and was like “this is what’s wrong with our workforce”",,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:22:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,He’s a hypochondriac,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:22:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And calls in like every other day...it’s annoying to listen to,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:23:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But my point is that he was playing the victim when I know that he was completely fine 90% of the time he would “call in”,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:24:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,Most of them are bs (my team) they straight tell us they didn’t feel like coming.,,,,,

,7/19/2019,16:25:49,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hugely painful. Calling out is no where close to my biggest issue,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:26:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur staff is literally giving u the finger and saying “not my problem”,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:26:19,12026045322,Ben Deane,Worst thing is all the racism claims,,,,,

,7/19/2019,16:28:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,They can’t/don’t,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:29:03,12026045322,Ben Deane,It’s the easiest way for the union to get out of a write up,,,,,
,7/19/2019,16:32:09,12026045322,Ben Deane,Our kitchen manager is black and the majority of the cooks are Hispanic so he’s constantly getting rocked,,,,,

,7/19/2019,17:31:10,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think it’s multiple factors,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:31:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hospitality union is pretty strong. We’re nothing compared to Chicago and New York,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:32:16,12026045322,Ben Deane,Primarily lower educated team members. Vast majority from South America or southeast,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:33:23,12026045322,Ben Deane,And I bet most people that have to manage union team members struggle with it,,,,,
,7/19/2019,17:33:25,12026045322,Ben Deane,We’re also owned by a union so they know them being unionized will never be in jeopardy,,,,,

,8/8/2019,15:03:08,12026045322,Ben Deane,He’s young he won’t get tired,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:16:40,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Truth,,,I can’t wait to go on tilt during the draft. It’s the best 10 minutes ever followed by 3 hours of buyers remorse,8/8/2019,14:54:37
,8/8/2019,15:18:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Ben you worried about the Giants scoring 0 TDs this year?,,,,,

,8/8/2019,15:20:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,Also I haven’t bet on anything in a while,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:20:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"You’ve def got a shot, I just don’t think it’s 33%",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:20:57,12026045322,Ben Deane,Got bored,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:07,12026045322,Ben Deane,Strong 20-25%,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I think that’s right,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Gotta roll the 🎲,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’ll take 5/1 if you give it to me?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:21:47,12026045322,Ben Deane,For saquon?!,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:04,12026045322,Ben Deane,It would be a guaranteed loss for me,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah basically cancel your bet for $10,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:22:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,I’m good,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:23:46,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,This definitely seems more legit,,,I’ll take 5/1 if you give it to me?,8/8/2019,15:21:36
,8/8/2019,15:23:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But on the other hand, Ben was talkin shit",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:24:43,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And I think this is too high,,,$120 ,8/8/2019,14:52:49
,8/8/2019,15:24:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,$80 for the rest of the roster is rough,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:25:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"After a solid WR, you have All below average players",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:30:10,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Preach,,,I still wouldn’t go over 100,8/8/2019,14:54:23
,8/8/2019,15:31:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you’d pay $70 for an RB that you’re admiring only has a 20% chance to finish as first but only $100 for someone who is guaranteed first?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:31:58,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"No, I’ve never paid $70 for the top RB",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:33:25,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Scotty got the rb1 last year for like $55,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:33:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,How’d that shot work out for him?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:35:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah I forgot the last couple years we’ve chilled right now,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:35:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Chilled right out,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:36:08,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So yeah maybe $120 is too much,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:36:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe y’all are right... def not under 100 though,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:37:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Even if you got a WR2 after, the rest of your roster is scrubs",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:37:56,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You can’t wait with scrubs,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:00,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Win,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:31,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Very true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Sure but you can win with the best player and a bunch of average players,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But I don’t think you’re even getting average,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:56,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Ben trying winning with scrubs for like the first 3 years he was in the league,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:38:58,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like $100 is the price of your top 2,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:01,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Never worked,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"So you’re just saying instead of 2 top players, you’re getting a guaranteed 1",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:39:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Then the rest of your team is the same,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:02,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You’re getting God tier RB and tier 3 everyone else,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I just don’t think it works,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:40:34,18048190003,Krista Gunter,You’re relying on sleepers at that point,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:42:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I saw a 2qb ranking that had Mahomes at #4 overall,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:42:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Ridiculous,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:44:09,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And Peter Schrager said Kyler Murray excitement this year is the same as Mahomes excitement was last year at training camp,,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:53:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"FYI I’m sending out the survey tonight, so last chance for any ideas to the email thread",,,,,
,8/8/2019,15:59:05,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Krista reminder to include a question asking for respondent name so we know who we are waiting on,,,,,

,8/8/2019,16:50:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,15 points feels too much for a shut out,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:51:14,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And the difference between 0 and 7 is bonkers (15 to 6),,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:51:30,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I lose 9 points because someone scored a TD on me!?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Shutouts are less than 1% in the last decade,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:11,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s too painful and not at all representative of actually game value since both are great defensive games,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:53:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Dunc has a point that it should be highly rewarded,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:03,12026045322,Ben Deane,If a defense has a shutout they have so many points already,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:27,12026045322,Ben Deane,I think 1-9 should be highly rewarded,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:54:35,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Well if we’re talking representative, we need defenses to be much more valuable overall",,,That’s too painful and not at all representative of actually game value since both are great defensive games,8/8/2019,16:53:11
,8/8/2019,16:55:39,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Last time a Super Bowl team didn’t have a top 10 defense was Peyton’s 2006 Colts,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:56:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,I wonder what that stat on offense is,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:56:52,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Great question, I’ll research that tonight",,,I wonder what that stat on offense is,8/8/2019,16:56:14
,8/8/2019,16:57:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah but I think making defenses too powerful in fantasy without going IDP takes some of the skill out of it in my opinion,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:19,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I’m guessing the Seahawks are the only ones this century,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But how do you measure “top 10 defense” according to your stat?  It’s not the same measures that make a good fantasy defense,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:57:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And that’s my issue,,,,,
,8/8/2019,16:59:13,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Points Against.,,,But how do you measure “top 10 defense” according to your stat?  It’s not the same measures that make a good fantasy defense,8/8/2019,16:57:53
,8/8/2019,16:59:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"And I agree with your point, which is why Dunc’s scale should help with that",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:01:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I agree we need a revamp of the scoring system for points to matter more,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:02:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe we make points matter a ton and the rest of the shit matter less,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:02:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"I also agree with this. I don’t want to make defense too powerful, just at least in the same league as the other positions",,,Yeah but I think making defenses too powerful in fantasy without going IDP takes some of the skill out of it in my opinion,8/8/2019,16:57:00
,8/8/2019,17:04:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Touchdowns are big swings which seems to bother people,,,Maybe we make points matter a ton and the rest of the shit matter less,8/8/2019,17:02:21
,8/8/2019,17:09:57,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Even though when Austin Hooper’s ass scored 3 TDs against me, I didn’t say we need to restructure how TEs score",,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:13:24,14344222842,Luke Wray,Dumbest shit I've ever heard scooter,,,I heard JJ wanted a trade to TB,8/8/2019,11:59:13
,8/8/2019,17:15:40,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah I was guessing he was just trolling you,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Nah,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:09,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Heard it on dan lebatard,,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:17:36,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yup,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:17:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"I didn’t put much merit to it, but they talked for a good while about it",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:18:25,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The segment started with JJ breaking that kids bike and if he should buy the kid a new bike,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:19:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And they talked about that for 10 min...then another 10 min about him wanting a trade and Clouney being a FA next year,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,What’s the stat for the reverse of this? For teams that allow 35+ points a game,,,Shutouts are less than 1% in the last decade,8/8/2019,16:53:05
,8/8/2019,17:20:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I think a shutout should be rewarded, but not so severe.",,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:33,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Actually I think defenses should be punished more heavily for allowing more points,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:20:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It should be like -10 for allowing 35+ in a game,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:21:37,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But if that’s also around 1% of games in a season then idk,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Absolutely u should give 15 for a shutout...you have guaranteed ur team a win,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,In real fb,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:22:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,But that also means the defense did well in other areas were already giving points for,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,A shutout should be the equivalent of an offensive player having a 45 point game....with all the 3 and outs and such it probably is,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:16,15408158419,Scott Gunter,15 is not too much,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Sacks/picks/4th down stops etc,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:23:33,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Excellent,,,But that also means the defense did well in other areas were already giving points for,8/8/2019,17:22:49
,8/8/2019,17:23:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,A def with a shutout should get like 45,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:32,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But like we need to make these decisions this week bc it alters my whole draft strategy,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:24:33,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Is that what we want for defenses though?,,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:34:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But the whole point of adding those other things was to make people excited about def,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:36:16,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah and it's nice to value the tangible, measurable things that a DEF does",,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:46:25,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I just looked at every score from every week last year,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:46:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So yes it’s true,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:47:29,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Including 24-0 eagles over skins week 17, so that def would have scored like 40 something according to the proposed new scoring",,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:48:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Was going off of this stat,,,But if that’s also around 1% of games in a season then idk,8/8/2019,17:21:37
,8/8/2019,17:50:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s closer to like 3% of games in the season are shutouts,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Maybe the problem is that we’re duplicating - points against a defense should be the primary factor that gives defense fantasy points,,,,,

,8/8/2019,17:50:46,14344222842,Luke Wray,So let's say a defense goes ham one week,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But defensive touchdowns also help the team a ton but wouldn’t show up in points against,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:50:59,14344222842,Luke Wray,What point total do they deserve?,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:12,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But a def that has a shut out is like a wr having 200 yds and 2 tds,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:20,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Should be like 40 points,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:32,18048190003,Krista Gunter,If a def goes ham there score should be like 25 points for the game,,,What point total do they deserve?,8/8/2019,17:50:59
,8/8/2019,17:51:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,We should get rid of points for sacks and anything that’s not a turnover,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:34,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Not 40,,,,,
,8/8/2019,17:51:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Not a fan of this,,,We should get rid of points for sacks and anything that’s not a turnover,8/8/2019,17:51:33

,8/8/2019,18:01:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The concern is that defenses are a fucking crapshoot,,,,,

,8/8/2019,18:02:51,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So that is where the bracket would come in,,,,,
,8/8/2019,18:02:56,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So maybe the solution is just revamp the points against scoring,,,,,

,8/8/2019,18:03:25,15408158419,Scott Gunter,More points for under 7,,,,,
,8/8/2019,18:03:49,18048190003,Krista Gunter,If we’re gonna consider 15 for shutouts it should be at least -10 for a 40-40 game,,,,,
,8/8/2019,18:04:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’d buy into that,,,,,
,8/8/2019,18:04:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc u would end up like -5 and that seems about right,,,,,
,8/8/2019,18:04:40,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Dunc and Mark have proposed only 1 less point,,,,,

,8/8/2019,18:05:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Only problem with this is that some people might not play a defense because they’d rather get zero than risk negative points,,,More penalty for over 35,8/8/2019,18:03:16

,8/12/2019,11:40:52,84986222184,David Casstevens,Its an extra wrinkle to think about first the next three weeks. Then when we get in the draft room we will see how good everyone's poker face is,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:41:04,84986222184,David Casstevens,😳😳,,,,,
,8/12/2019,11:46:07,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I wanna see everyone’s face 10 min before the draft starts if we do the random generator then,,,,,

,8/12/2019,12:52:31,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah, so you cant come with a specific game plan",,,I think we should generate the nomination list at the beginning of the draft,8/12/2019,10:30:14
,8/12/2019,13:10:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"also, i think we should be able to use whatever tools for draft day",,,,,

,8/12/2019,13:22:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"lol, we haven't had restrictions before",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:22:32,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"Is it a tool that is available to everyone, or something you want to keep secret",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:22:41,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"if the goal is to make the draft an even playing field, then we should all have the opportunity to have the exact same tools",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:23:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think the draft tools that update during draft make for a more competitive draft, which I like",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:24:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"otherwise, it's the people with the best spreadsheet skills that will have an advantage",,,,,
,8/12/2019,13:24:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,because you can essentially create an auto-updating tool within spreadsheets,,,,,

,8/12/2019,13:59:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The experts that made my app vs the ones that made yours,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:00:08,12026152479,Bryan Lee,There's still skill involved in making the decisions,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:00:34,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Much less,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:01:42,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I think it's better to have a more competitive draft though,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:02:06,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Why?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:02:33,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I think it's more fun when it's more competitive. Both during the draft and during the season,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:17,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Equality of outcome, huh?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,Its not as fun if there are clear runaway winners and losers,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:29,12026152479,Bryan Lee,No equality of opportunity,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:03:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Exact opposite,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:04:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You want no clear winners or losers of the draft,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:04:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also you want us all using virtual draft assistants during the draft?  That can’t be more fun,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:06:16,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This isn’t true,,,"That's kind of what I was saying, technically a sufficiently impressive spreadsheet approaches the utility of software",8/12/2019,13:58:03
,8/12/2019,14:06:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,My brain is basically a virtual draft assistant. Is that cheating?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Only if Bry and Dunc get their way Ben,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:15,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Then you won’t be able to use your brain,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:22,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hahaha,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:07:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,I barely do anyway so we good!!!,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:08:04,12026045322,Ben Deane,God I’m gonna run circles around you fools again,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:08:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,The reason this isn’t true is you need to make all types of assumptions and shit when updating your ranks and expected costs on the fly,,,This isn’t true,8/12/2019,14:06:16
,8/12/2019,14:08:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Having a computer do that for you means using the skill and knowledge and assumption of experts,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:09:11,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think it elevates the level of strategy when you have most of the book keeping type things automated for you on the fly,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:09:38,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like the human + computer chess matches, computer is good at keeping track of the low level tactics, so it frees the human up to focus on higher level strategy",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"if your entire draft is just scrambling to see how many WRs are left, how much budget you have left, who has drafted who, it's very low level strategy",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Hey Bryan, we out here playing chess and pats playing checkers! N’am saying?!?!",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What strategy is left when a draft assistant updates the expected cost of every player according to your team and what people have paid for previous players?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,hahhah exactly,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,there's a lot of strategy left,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:10:49,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pat so mad at me right now,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Hahaha,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you used an assistant last year, if you follow it blindly it doesn't do shit for you",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:12,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m arguing for fun,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,There’s no way this gets passed in a vote so this doesn’t really matter,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:33,12026045322,Ben Deane,That’s only true if everyone is using it,,,"you used an assistant last year, if you follow it blindly it doesn't do shit for you",8/12/2019,14:11:05
,8/12/2019,14:11:35,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah it's more fun to not worry about basic book keeping during the draft and updating draft dollars,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:55,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"My spreadsheet is just rank aggregations and notes, I have to do all the value assessments on the fly like everyone else",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:11:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But what strategy is left Bry?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:11,12026152479,Bryan Lee,composing a good team,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:22,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Yeah this is a huge difference,,,"My spreadsheet is just rank aggregations and notes, I have to do all the value assessments on the fly like everyone else",8/12/2019,14:11:55
,8/12/2019,14:12:27,12406785346,Duncan Bell,But if you got crazy you could have a spreadsheet do the value assessments too,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Or at least help you,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:41,12026045322,Ben Deane,We still got marky out here!,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:12:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You can’t really Dunc,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Mark over here like “hole up Sarah this is important”,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,I feel like I’m providing some good color commentary right now,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:23,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you have to decide when you should overpay or wait, you still can decide to go 0 RB or not, you can go heavy on QBs, you can go studs n duds or a bunch of avg joes",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:47,12026152479,Bryan Lee,you can see what players or positions other people need to fill and try and screw up their strategy,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:53,19176901767,Patrick Deane,So you decide when to disagree with your app,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:13:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I need to change what I'm doing this year to be able to handle nominations.  That's a huge change,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:12,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Bryan, why doesn’t your first letter in your sentence get capitalized?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:20,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah i mean that's the thing with all of this, even in snake drafts, if you just blindly follow the ADP cheat sheets, you'll have a horribel draft",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:24,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s talking,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,Oh,,,,,

,8/12/2019,14:14:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,That’s cheating ma dude,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:14:44,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"lol, I don't know, probably because i'm typing on a computer, not on a phone",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:15:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Pat answering my questions all fast so I go away,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:15:23,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"pat, when you used your assistant last year, did you just follow the exact $ numbers for each player and just try to bid to that number and that's it?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:15:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,#cantstopwontstop,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,and what about real NFL team managers? they all have access to the same info,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:31,12026152479,Bryan Lee,there's still strategy involved,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"No I actually didn’t use it that much, but definitely used it as a macro guide to where value was left",,,"pat, when you used your assistant last year, did you just follow the exact $ numbers for each player and just try to bid to that number and that's it?",8/12/2019,14:15:23
,8/12/2019,14:16:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But I could have followed it to the letter,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:16:57,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And that’s what we did for our #bensfriend league pretty much,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think if you follow it to the letter, you'll end up drafting poorly",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:30,12026152479,Bryan Lee,it's like following a cheat sheet using ADP in a snake draft,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:17:44,19176901767,Patrick Deane,No it’s not because that doesn’t update,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:06,19176901767,Patrick Deane,This draft assistant updates live based on your team,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:19,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you don't need it to update, you just take whoever is at the top of the ADP who hasn't yet been selected",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That doesn’t account for your team though,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:18:36,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Where as these do,,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:20:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"nominations also add a ton of strategy that these tools can't help with, it's up to the person",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:20:55,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I feel personally attached here,,,"if your entire draft is just scrambling to see how many WRs are left, how much budget you have left, who has drafted who, it's very low level strategy",8/12/2019,14:10:16

,8/12/2019,14:21:46,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"lol i mean, that's essentially all we'll have time to focus on in if we have to do all of our house keeping manually",,,I feel personally attached here,8/12/2019,14:20:55
,8/12/2019,14:22:35,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"which i think is less fun, it keeps you out of the action and less focused on the actual auction happening",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:22:59,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"you end up tuning out when it gets to someone you don't care about, so you can catch up on your house keeping",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:28:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like when NFL teams are in the draft choosing who to take next, they're not bogged down in trying to figure out logistical items, they have a team for that and they have algorithms, their job is to make the big decisions on who to go with once they have all of the data available to them",,,,,
,8/12/2019,14:29:03,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"we want to be like the top decision maker in our drafts, not the role of the software or assistant who is just aggregating information",,,,,
,8/12/2019,15:44:22,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I think the problem is the perception that such tools serve as an advantage to those using them, BECAUSE they don't have to do the housekeeping",,,,,
,8/12/2019,15:52:16,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"I agree, but isn't that what spreadsheets help with too?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,15:56:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Exactly what I was thinking,,,My brain is basically a virtual draft assistant. Is that cheating?,8/12/2019,14:06:24
,8/12/2019,16:08:22,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Yeah, so it's not a clear distinction",,,"I agree, but isn't that what spreadsheets help with too?",8/12/2019,15:52:16

,8/12/2019,16:37:36,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,The distinction would honestly be to have a gentleman’s agreement that nobody uses draft assistants during the draft that specifically updates value,,,"Yeah, so it's not a clear distinction",8/12/2019,16:08:22

,8/12/2019,16:38:41,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m not sold on the “snake” tho,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:38:56,14344222842,Luke Wray,Just thought of this and wanted to make sure it was a rule,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:38:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I thought we would go in order and circle like we’ve always done,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:39:37,14344222842,Luke Wray,We could snake for the first 2 rounds then circle?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:39:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I dunno,,,,,
,8/12/2019,16:40:16,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My thoughts are that we should do circle,,,,,

,8/12/2019,16:40:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I just want to establish the rotation before we assign numbers,,,,,

,8/12/2019,18:49:20,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i think we should do circle from the start,,,,,
,8/12/2019,18:50:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and make the order random and revealed one at a time as the nominations come up, i.e. pick a name out of a hat, that person nominates first, pick another name out of a hat, that person nominates second, etc. and then we'll have the established order",,,,,
,8/12/2019,18:50:52,12026152479,Bryan Lee,this way it limits the advantage of people getting to nominate earlier if they don't know when they'll actually go,,,,,

,8/12/2019,19:35:41,84986222184,David Casstevens,I'm pretty sure if I was using one it would be an extreme advantage for me. There are analytics and there are manalytics,,,,,

,8/12/2019,19:51:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,Okay so my guess is that Bryan and Duncan use it. Well they both haven't had a bad team in three years. Everyone else has had at least one stinker. Maybe it does safeguard you from drafting an atrocious team. I dunno,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:51:45,84986222184,David Casstevens,Duncan what are you thinking,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:52:42,84986222184,David Casstevens,Do you think it is an advantage for you. Your teams have been top 4 for 4 years straight or is it because you are just an amazing drafter?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,19:55:31,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Duncan and Bryan (except 1 year a piece) have made the playoffs every year since 2010,,,,,

,8/12/2019,20:08:42,12026152479,Bryan Lee,well i've only used the tool last 3 years,,,,,
,8/12/2019,20:09:28,18048190003,Krista Gunter,So either just luck or some skill involved,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:24:12,14344222842,Luke Wray,I second the motion,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:24:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think Pat says the phrase “rule change” and immediately gets a boner,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:29:21,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would vote to use it. Anyone who doesn’t use it is making that choice,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:31:14,14344222842,Luke Wray,I dont like this. It gets the feeling like we need to put in a ton of research and buy fancy draft things to have a chance,,,,,

,8/12/2019,22:31:42,14344222842,Luke Wray,And talking shit,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:31:57,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But Ben,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:32:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,There’s a difference between research beforehand and live reactive models,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:34:20,18048190003,Krista Gunter,"I think if you are having a live draft model you need to disclose it to everyone, and make it available for anyone to use",,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:34:40,18048190003,Krista Gunter,Or disclose where you got it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:34:47,18048190003,Krista Gunter,And then if people want to use it fine,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:05,14344222842,Luke Wray,Why has it even come to this wtf,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:06,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I agree with this,,,So much goes into the season more than the draft,8/12/2019,22:28:39
,8/12/2019,22:35:16,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I wouldn’t use it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:21,18048190003,Krista Gunter,The draft is too much fun,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I have motioned the rule change to not allow it comepletely and would like to vote on that,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:35:50,15408158419,Scott Gunter,If people want to vote allow and discuss more we can...no?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:37:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Lol damn,,,"Yes, but need to get out the electron microscope to see it",8/12/2019,22:24:51
,8/12/2019,22:37:40,14344222842,Luke Wray,Haha,,,,,
,8/12/2019,22:38:39,14344222842,Luke Wray,"I have had really shitty drafts the last 3 years, looking forward to this year",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:04:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think we should go with a free market and everyone is free to draft the way they enjoy more and find more fun, if you like taking the analytical approach than you can go that way, if you like going with your gut and instincts, then you can do that too",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:05:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think if we really think it presents an unfair advantage then anyone who decides to use a tool or use a spreadsheet must share it openly with everyone else and it must be free, so anyone can use it during the draft",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:08:32,84986222184,David Casstevens,Interesting,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:11:50,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like did anyone feel like they had less fun by the way duncan, myself or pat were bidding during last year's draft?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:15:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So Bryan votes yes to keep,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:15:58,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And prolly Duncan,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:17:37,12026152479,Bryan Lee,well i think we need to get more specific with what we're banning,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:17:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,what are you proposing exactly scotty?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:18:10,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This,,,I think u should be allowed to look up whatever u want with regards to recommendations and stats but u shouldn’t be allowed to update a model or spreadsheet that adapts those recommendations based on our draft,8/12/2019,16:11:10
,8/12/2019,23:18:51,12026152479,Bryan Lee,what do you mean by recommendations based on our draft? and model or spreadsheet that adapts? like would our spreadsheet used to track our teams fall into this?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:18:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Well I’m proposing we vote on options,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And I want that to be an option,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:04,12026152479,Bryan Lee,it updates remaining $$ by team according to drafted players,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That’s extreme bry,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:31,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:19:49,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, which is why I just want clarity on what we're banning versus not",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:20:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Do you have to input something into ur research? If so, prolly not allowed",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:20:43,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Unless it’s league rules,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:21:06,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like am I allowed to keep track of how much $ is being spent per team on position?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:21:34,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"or how much I've spent per position, have a budget for a position, and have that budget be eaten into as I draft players?",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bry ur getting extreme,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:17,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur asking “am I allowed to budget”,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,because excel or spreadsheets are literally just models that update,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:30,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The answer is it depends,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:39,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Did u build the spreadsheet?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:22:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i know we're allowed to budget, what i don't know is if we're allowed to automatically update budgets based upon draft choices",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:15,12026152479,Bryan Lee,does it matter if i build it or not?,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Yes,,,does it matter if i build it or not?,8/12/2019,23:23:15
,8/12/2019,23:23:32,12026152479,Bryan Lee,then we're saying the person with the best excel skills will have an advantage over those who don't,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:33,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Very much so,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:23:56,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Doesn’t have to be excel,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Best budgeting skills yes,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:32,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Also this is just my opinion,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:46,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m only 10% of the population,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And we should vote on it,,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:24:57,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i mean i think your opinion matters a lot though if your the one putting forward a motion to ban something",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:25:43,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"like i'm the kind of person that will use technology to try and get an advantage, and i'll take it up to the line of what's allowed, without cheating",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:26:36,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"so i'm okay if we ban any outside tool/spreadsheet, we have to be able to build all of our tools we want to use, i just need to know what i can build",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:27:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"So my opinion is that if ur paying or receiving information that adapts in real time based on the draft that is outside ur person, ur over the line",,,,,
,8/12/2019,23:27:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Lol,,,"so i'm okay if we ban any outside tool/spreadsheet, we have to be able to build all of our tools we want to use, i just need to know what i can build",8/12/2019,23:26:36

,8/13/2019,7:07:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I would describe it as any external software (not built by you) that requires real time inputs and updates during the draft,,,,,
,8/13/2019,9:16:54,12406785346,Duncan Bell,This definition is workable I think,,,I would describe it as any external software (not built by you) that requires real time inputs and updates during the draft,8/13/2019,7:07:55

,8/14/2019,9:35:01,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think it’s random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,9:36:06,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It is random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,9:36:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And there’s no way to change it,,,,,

,8/14/2019,11:33:08,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So like let’s say the pot is $1000,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:33:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And you take the jags for $5...and the first round is 2%,,,,,

,8/14/2019,11:34:01,12026045322,Ben Deane,Love that. But it’s basically the same thing we do. We just pay out at the end,,,,,

,8/14/2019,11:36:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I only get $2 if they win the first round?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:36:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Not worth it,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:36:44,12026045322,Ben Deane,HahahahHa this is cracking me up,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:37:03,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Mark!,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:37:19,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ur retarded,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:38:26,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That sounds much better than current playoff pool to be honest,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:38:55,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"It’s basically the exact same thing, but bids aren’t blind",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:10,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And more payoffs,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:14,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The only blind part is u don’t know what the total pool is at until the end,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I love it,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:27,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But there’s one other rule,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:37,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So everyone can buy in with $100,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:39:52,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"If u only spend $30, you only spend $30",,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But everything over $100 is 2:1,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:15,15408158419,Scott Gunter,So $110 bid costs me $120,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:25,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Why would we do that?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,What’s the point of that rule?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:40:44,15408158419,Scott Gunter,2 reasons,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,1- it prevents a #1 team for going way too cheap,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:05,12026152479,Bryan Lee,otherwise one person could buy every team in every round?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:17,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And 2- what Bryan said,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:29,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It entices more people to bid,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:41:49,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Bc people get close to $100 and don’t wanna go into luxury tax,,,,,
,8/14/2019,11:42:01,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Is Bernie Sanders in this league?,,,But everything over $100 is 2:1,8/14/2019,11:40:02

,8/14/2019,12:19:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My thought is that they randomly assign a number to each team 1-10 and then they have a schedule template where 1 plays 3 week 1 and so on,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:19:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,This would imply a random generation of who plays who,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:19:47,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Ie you have the same chance of playing me as you would Ben,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:20:05,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"So from 2016-2017, there’s a 10% chance it’s the same",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:20:35,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The template probably doesn’t change from year to year,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:21:00,15408158419,Scott Gunter,But in no way do they use any prior data from our league to generate the schedule,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:23:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think there's got to be more than 10 templates for a 10 person league.  That would suggest that the order within a season remains the same each year,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:24:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Ah but you could be right, assigning a random number and then assigning random template of 10",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:25:02,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Still that's way more than 10 possible schedules,,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:26:41,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It has to be 1 template,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:26:53,15408158419,Scott Gunter,With random team # assignment,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:27:23,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Which would be everyone has the same % to play everyone ...which implies randomness,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:28:37,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Probability is hard,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:29:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i think in this case, the simplest explanation is the most likely one. Either we didn't set the schedule to be random that year and we did the other years, or their algorithm for that one year was different than the other years, and maybe it just copied the schedule from last year's season if there were no change in players",,,,,

,8/14/2019,12:49:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"even if we go with your template theory scott, there must be way more than 10 templates, otherwise any season in which any person plays the same person week 1 as any previous season would mean the entire schedule would be the exact same - and we know pat played against ben week 1 more than one time and the entire season schedules weren't the same",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:49:55,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so there must be at least 40 templates at a minimum,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:13,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Maybe,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:24,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Maybe there’s 1 but it gets updates,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:51,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Either way, there’s a 10% chance of playing different people...ie rabdom",,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:50:55,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so .06% chance it was random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,12:51:11,15408158419,Scott Gunter,In the 40 template scenario sure,,,,,
,8/14/2019,13:01:57,12026045322,Ben Deane,Omg guys. Need a disclaimer at the top of this conversation ‘the only person interested in this will be Dunc’ please skip ahead 100 messages,,,,,
,8/14/2019,13:22:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,Live on the betting app ma dudes!,,,,,
,8/14/2019,13:27:06,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I'll bet $5 that it's extra,,,"The real question is, is it extra?",8/14/2019,12:37:21
,8/14/2019,13:44:07,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Haahaha,,,Omg guys. Need a disclaimer at the top of this conversation ‘the only person interested in this will be Dunc’ please skip ahead 100 messages,8/14/2019,13:01:57
,8/14/2019,14:37:32,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Completely false,,,"So from 2016-2017, there’s a 10% chance it’s the same",8/14/2019,12:20:05
,8/14/2019,14:38:54,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’m just making my way through these but that’s not 100% random as you were saying,,,My thought is that they randomly assign a number to each team 1-10 and then they have a schedule template where 1 plays 3 week 1 and so on,8/14/2019,12:19:05
,8/14/2019,14:40:45,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Great point,,,"even if we go with your template theory scott, there must be way more than 10 templates, otherwise any season in which any person plays the same person week 1 as any previous season would mean the entire schedule would be the exact same - and we know pat played against ben week 1 more than one time and the entire season schedules weren't the same",8/14/2019,12:49:27
,8/14/2019,14:40:58,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’ll give both of you $5 to end this debate right now,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:41:38,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Bro you’re going back on yourself,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:42:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,You wouldn’t have said you think it’s 100% random if what you meant is that they have templates,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:42:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Also the 8 (not 10) template theory is debunked by Bry,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:43:22,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Either way the fact that it was the same 2 years in a row means that it can’t be completely random,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:43:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Any amount of randomness would make the probably of getting the same schedule almost impossible,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:44:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Therefore any any system that lead to a schedule being the same 2 years in a row is not a random system,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:44:50,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"So you owe me $5, just need Dunc to confirm",,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:45:13,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Wow Dunc,,,I'll bet $5 that it's extra,8/14/2019,13:27:06
,8/14/2019,14:52:10,12406785346,Duncan Bell,What exactly am I supposed to do here,,,"So you owe me $5, just need Dunc to confirm",8/14/2019,14:44:50
,8/14/2019,14:52:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Opine on who won the bet or if it’s a push because terms weren’t specific enough,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:53:15,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Dunc- please define “random”,,,What exactly am I supposed to do here,8/14/2019,14:52:10
,8/14/2019,14:53:45,15408158419,Scott Gunter,My definition is equal probability for all members,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:53:55,19176901767,Patrick Deane,All outcomes,,,My definition is equal probability for all members,8/14/2019,14:53:45

,8/14/2019,14:54:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Wtf does “members” mean?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:54:57,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And it’s random by drawing names out of a hat,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:54:59,15408158419,Scott Gunter,No?,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:55:18,15408158419,Scott Gunter,The template here is their schedule template,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:55:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,And they randomize the member being used at each slot,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:55:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,That’s my thinking,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:58:06,15408158419,Scott Gunter,"Thru ur thinking, u would have to draw a name out of a hat after every round",,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:59:26,15408158419,Scott Gunter,You can’t do it every round bc you have to ensure certain outcomes like “everyone has to play everyone once”,,,,,
,8/14/2019,14:59:34,15408158419,Scott Gunter,It’s a different type of statistics,,,,,
,8/14/2019,15:00:02,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I understand what u and Bryan are saying...ur just wrong,,,,,

,8/18/2019,17:56:01,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Dunc I’m not included in the best season, you have two kjs",,,,,
,8/18/2019,17:56:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Yeah because you haven’t had a best season B,,,,,
,8/18/2019,17:56:27,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Also Dunc, I’m not talking shit about you. It’s amazing what you’ve done. I’m just trying to get out of the cellar!",,,,,
,8/18/2019,17:56:33,12026045322,Ben Deane,Hahahaha shit,,,,,
,8/18/2019,17:57:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Anybody else think it’s a little fishy that Dunc is leading all the composite metrics?,,,,,
,8/18/2019,17:57:58,12026045322,Ben Deane,Lol he’s gained more points than me in the last two years!,,,,,

,8/18/2019,18:00:47,12026045322,Ben Deane,Everyone is within 20 points. Super close,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:01:02,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He made some changes last year to make it better but there is still a bunch of overlap with metrics,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:01:09,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But it’s now better than it was,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:02:35,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I did a 7 voice message monologue on it last year and everyone called me gay,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:02:46,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But made some great points,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:04:22,15408158419,Scott Gunter,SMH,,,,,
,8/18/2019,18:04:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I've had 4 consecutive really good seasons so any way you slice it my score is going to be good,,,,,

,8/18/2019,23:49:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,I had one terrible season one great season and made the playoffs out first round every other,,,,,
,8/18/2019,23:49:33,84986222184,David Casstevens,Its dead on,,,,,
8/19/2019,8/19/2019,7:48:00,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I just love that we don’t all have a common list that we’re working off of for the draft this year,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:05,84986222184,David Casstevens,Right,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:09,84986222184,David Casstevens,So great,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:06:30,84986222184,David Casstevens,Basically everyone is their own analyist,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:25:41,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,So we still need to vote on IR spot and to ban in-draft analyzing apps?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:25:53,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat has some interesting thoughts on IR spot,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:33:48,18048190003,Krista Gunter,What are we doing about FA,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:40:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Great call,,,,,
,8/19/2019,8:41:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think we should just do away with the 11am rule and go back to the way it was,,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:10:55,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If you don’t $0 faab bid, then Dave will have an advantage on you",,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:11:18,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"But if you forget to $0 faab bid, that’s on you anyway",,,,,
,8/19/2019,9:12:39,18048190003,Krista Gunter,And it multiple people have $0 faab for a player then it defaults to the waiver list,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:09,12026045322,Ben Deane,So Dunc,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:13,12026045322,Ben Deane,I was thinking,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:46:48,12026045322,Ben Deane,"You need to figure out a way to automate your rankings, charge like $50 a league per year and make about 10 billion dollars",,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:47:20,12026045322,Ben Deane,It’s the toughest thing ever,,,,,
,8/19/2019,14:47:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,Everyone would pay,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Yeah Yahoo should hire me,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:34,12026045322,Ben Deane,Fuck yahoo,,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:09:55,12026045322,Ben Deane,"Advertise that shit on Instagram, god you would make so much money",,,,,
,8/19/2019,15:57:30,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"I know, it would be awesome to automate it.  It's possible, though not a small lift",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:00:55,12026152479,Bryan Lee,I don't think it would be too complicated if done as a web app,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:02:28,12406785346,Duncan Bell,It WOULD make so much money if done right,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:16:17,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"Mark do you remember your 2007 season?  It turns out that was the third best point performance in the league history, yet you came in last place",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:19:09,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i have a hard time seeing the service being profitable, but i think it could be a good acquisition target by someone like Yahoo - since them offering this kind of multi-year league analysis would help prevent people from moving their league to another platform",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:19:57,12406785346,Duncan Bell,"There's a big market, and if sold as subscription....",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:21:27,12026152479,Bryan Lee,the problem is that the value of the service would only show up once a year and for a brief period,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:21:48,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"it's like a \""oh, nice to know\"" kind of thing - something that would be a feature of a platform like yahoo or espn",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:00,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's true.  But I think there's a big enough market that you'd make money.  And then each year you charge to update existing customers with latest league data,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:32,12026045322,Ben Deane,I wonder how many leagues there are,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:35,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i don't think you could charge very much though,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:44,12026045322,Ben Deane,$50 a year?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:52,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would easily pay $5 to get this,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:23:53,12026152479,Bryan Lee,like even fully featured services like Fantasy pros is cheaper than $50/year,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:08,12026045322,Ben Deane,Does fantasy pros do all this?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:28,12026045322,Ben Deane,I would pay $50/ year by my self to have this,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:24:45,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"they give you ongoing news, expert analysis, up to date analytics to start/sit, draft kits, cheat sheets, waiver wire, etc.",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:25:32,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and a business model where you charge per league is awkward, because you then have to get a bunch of people to pool their money together to make a payment for a league thing",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:26:42,12406785346,Duncan Bell,That's a good point.  Anyway yeah I think $50 might be too high.  All of this depends also on how much it would cost to develop,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:28:54,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"the current bias of the fantasy service/tool market, is that people are willing to pay $ in order to get a competitive edge over their competition, but all of the analysis, news and stuff are all free",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:29:24,14344222842,Luke Wray,@15408158419 did dude take the trade?,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:29:54,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"and it'd be very easy for a competitor to replicate, within the league software and not have to log into a separate service",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:39:51,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Also true.  But I guess the hope would be to get acquired by Yahoo or ESPN,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:47:10,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah, i think the only way for that to happen though, is to have a ton of users - because if it's just the historical analysis, they'll probably just copy it with an in-house development team",,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:47:39,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so they'd be acquiring primarily the user base and secondarily the analysis,,,,,
,8/19/2019,16:48:17,12026152479,Bryan Lee,so maybe free service with ads would actually be the best route to both get a lot of users and to help pay for your costs,,,,,

,8/24/2019,10:50:23,84986222184,David Casstevens,Yes,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:50:27,84986222184,David Casstevens,100%,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:54:22,84986222184,David Casstevens,It makes the draft so much better and we have all these extra positions and we didn't extend the bench,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:56:40,84986222184,David Casstevens,Also we have three receiver slots which means if one is injured and another is on by you have to carry 5 just to fill oit a team,,,,,
,8/24/2019,10:58:10,84986222184,David Casstevens,And last year I would have been able to keep Henry and Winston to waivers. #bullshit #yourwelcomeben,,,,,

,8/24/2019,11:16:20,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I’d be cool to vote on that as part of the IR vote,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:16:31,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That would be a good way of breaking the IR tie,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:17:17,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Yeah me too, but all questions should have only two options for final vote",,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:17:37,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But we didn’t make any progress on the IR vote,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:18:01,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Think we need to consider that we might need 2 more votes on IR/bench,,,,,
,8/24/2019,11:19:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,One of the options had 4 votes,,,But we didn’t make any progress on the IR vote,8/24/2019,11:17:37
,8/24/2019,11:19:20,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Just do that one against extra bench spot,,,,,

,8/25/2019,18:27:39,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And if so do we think the people who drafted them should get a free spot?,,,,,
,8/25/2019,18:28:49,12406785346,Duncan Bell,I think...no?  Has to be injured?  That's a good point and we would need to make sure IR spot isn't exploited like that,,,,,

,8/25/2019,19:07:09,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"yeah i absolutely agree on this point, people who saved money and filled out their roster during draft day get penalized, because you end up having to drop everyone just to cover byes and not drop your starters",,,2019_08_25_61E0FAB115691E4D30DD22205127893A.opus,8/25/2019,19:04:42

At the end of the draft when players are going for $1 getting to nominate is a bigger deal.  We need to switch to circle or snake at that point.,8/27/2019,22:57:33
,8/28/2019,14:30:50,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If so, we for sure shouldn’t do circle since it’s the most advantageous structure",,,,,

,9/3/2019,21:37:19,84986222184,David Casstevens,What's his value then?,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:37:33,84986222184,David Casstevens,Is he more valuable than kupp?,,,,,

,9/3/2019,21:40:03,84986222184,David Casstevens,I mean no ill will but when rbs are that slight of build the chance is definitely there,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:40:04,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Not sure. He was fairly pedestrian when he started after Cook went out.  Yeah the Vikes Oline was bad, but I would say hes a solid RB2 at that point. I dont get the hype some folks have if Kamara would miss time",,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:40:17,84986222184,David Casstevens,I see,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:40:24,84986222184,David Casstevens,Okay good to know,,,,,

,9/3/2019,21:41:49,84986222184,David Casstevens,Actually I think scantling might be 80% of kupp on AR's fuck you tour,,,,,
,9/3/2019,21:42:00,84986222184,David Casstevens,So I might not need kupp,,,,,

,9/4/2019,15:35:48,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. Understand the draft dollars difference. You definitely value them differently than I do. I honestly didnt even look at that since it sometimes depends on when a player is put up to bid,,,,,

,9/10/2019,19:08:59,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And Mark and I just made a bet $20 on Henry being top 5 if he plays all 16,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:09:07,12026045322,Ben Deane,Wow,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:09:14,12026045322,Ben Deane,People high on Henry,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:09:26,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I’ll add this one too,,,And Mark and I just made a bet $20 on Henry being top 5 if he plays all 16,9/10/2019,19:08:59
,9/10/2019,19:09:41,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Which was a great bet by Mark but I was mostly taking exception to the misleading nature of the statement,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:09:44,15408158419,Scott Gunter,I’m also in on that,,,And Mark and I just made a bet $20 on Henry being top 5 if he plays all 16,9/10/2019,19:08:59
,9/10/2019,19:09:52,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"Which Mark agrees with, that it was misleading",,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:10:04,19176901767,Patrick Deane,But not actually,,,I’m also in on that,9/10/2019,19:09:44
,9/10/2019,19:10:32,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Also not actually,,,"Which Mark agrees with, that it was misleading",9/10/2019,19:09:52
,9/10/2019,19:10:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Pat just got caught up,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:11:03,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,And then tried to rationalize his way out of it,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:11:23,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i got you scott, $20 on Henry not being a top 5 RB if he plays 16 games, out of all RBs that play 16 games",,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:11:37,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"Ben, you don’t think so?",,,And Mark and I just made a bet $20 on Henry being top 5 if he plays all 16,9/10/2019,19:08:59
,9/10/2019,19:11:40,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Not the bet,,,"i got you scott, $20 on Henry not being a top 5 RB if he plays 16 games, out of all RBs that play 16 games",9/10/2019,19:11:23
,9/10/2019,19:11:48,19176901767,Patrick Deane,That’s worse than my bet Bry,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:12:01,15408158419,Scott Gunter,Scratch the out of part at the end,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:12:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i'd rather keep it,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:13:05,19176901767,Patrick Deane,It’s worse than my bet because like if Saquon plays 15 games he’ll beat Henry but you won’t have access,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:13:13,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah i cancel my bet,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:13:14,12026152479,Bryan Lee,haha,,,,,

,9/10/2019,19:14:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,But I don’t love it,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:14:28,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Game script is gonna be against titans a lot this season,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:14:40,12026045322,Ben Deane,And they’re terrible,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:14:42,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Henry is a good RB2,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:14:45,12026045322,Ben Deane,Same thing I guess,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:14:58,12026045322,Ben Deane,Just not gonna score that many tds,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:15:05,19176901767,Patrick Deane,He’s in the RB 10-15 conversation,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:15:29,12026045322,Ben Deane,He doesn’t catch the ball which is gonna hurt,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:15:31,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I still owe Mark $1 for the Nelson Agholor bet from last season,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:15:38,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Lol,,,I still owe Mark $1 for the Nelson Agholor bet from last season,9/10/2019,19:15:31
,9/10/2019,19:16:11,12026045322,Ben Deane,75yd td is a fluke,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:16:18,12026045322,Ben Deane,For any player not him,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:16:19,19176901767,Patrick Deane,"I will say, if Julio gets hurt or doesn’t play a few games this season it’s a great trade",,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:16:26,12026045322,Ben Deane,Without it he went for 100-1,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:17:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Alright I guess I’m rooting against Henry this season,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:18:07,19176901767,Patrick Deane,And I’ll try to stop shopping Conner out to people,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:18:24,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"If he misses a game, the bet is void",,,I mean no I don’t,9/10/2019,19:14:09

,9/10/2019,19:20:23,12026045322,Ben Deane,I get it. But that’s not what you’re rooting for,,,"If he misses a game, the bet is void",9/10/2019,19:18:24
,9/10/2019,19:20:42,12026045322,Ben Deane,It’s probably a pretty even bet,,,,,
,9/10/2019,19:24:23,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"@ben the trade isn't bad, but I just would never start LeSean McCoy ever - so i'd just be downgrading my WR",,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:05:07,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I thought the vote was to use Yahoo's rules for the IR spot with an injury. I'll drop him if need be I just get frustrated with some of these rule changes and keeping it straight.,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:05:42,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I couldn't pull Bell on IR last year with a Out designation because obviously it was a contract dispute.,,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:06:15,18048190003,Krista Gunter,I think the question on the poll said specifically for PUP or IR,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:06:34,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Thats fine. Then I'll drop him,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:06:51,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I think Luke has the dame situation,,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:07:24,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Guice is out Indefinitely,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:07:49,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,At least 6-8 weeks which I though we had 6 weeks as a threshold in the past,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:08:45,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"You might be roght Kris. I just thought we had changed from last year, and we couldn't use Out last year",,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:21:10,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I thought we changed something which is why I used it when it showed me the spot was available knowing he was out at least 6 weeks,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:22:45,84986222184,David Casstevens,So if your player is out six weeks he can go in IR spot?,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:28:54,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,"No, the 6 weeks thing was part of the Keep track ourselves proposal",,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:29:05,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,But that got voted down,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:33:37,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Yeah. It was you had to keep them there for 6 weeks min.,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:34:17,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Dave, just curious, does it give you the IR option for Hill?",,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:35:17,18048190003,Krista Gunter,It’s because teams aren’t designating any of these players to IR,,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:45:51,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,We need to streamline this next year. Too many exceptions,,,,,

,9/13/2019,8:56:56,12406785346,Duncan Bell,Can we not edit Yahoo rules to only allow PUP and IR?,,,,,
,9/13/2019,8:57:23,18048190003,Krista Gunter,For the record I voted to keep yahoo rules which included all of designations,,,,,

,9/13/2019,9:07:18,18048190003,Krista Gunter,They said he suffered a sprained ankle in preseason,,,,,
,9/13/2019,9:11:03,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,My confusion is that I could not use the Out designation last year for Bell. So I thought we had changed to allow Out with the Yahoo rules.,,,,,
,9/13/2019,9:12:12,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I probably voted for just IR and PUP as well not wanting somebody to be able to use an Out designation with a contract dispute like I couldn't last year.,,,,,
,9/13/2019,9:12:25,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,"Looks,like Yahoo has fixed that to be NA instead",,,,,

,9/18/2019,10:34:30,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I think Mahomes getting targets to Kelce and Watkins is slightly more probable than a comet to earth,,,,,

,9/18/2019,10:36:46,84986222184,David Casstevens,Pringle didn't score two scores and look good doing it,,,,,

,9/18/2019,16:04:13,12026045322,Ben Deane,Like what is the argument against him blowing up. He’s incredibly skilled and now playing with the best QB ever on an elite offense,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:04:15,12026152479,Bryan Lee,yeah i mean they were really feeding him in the beginning and he got a ton of red zone looks,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:04:28,12026152479,Bryan Lee,and he only played like 1/3 of the snaps or something,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:04:36,12026045322,Ben Deane,Remember when randy moss went to the pats?!,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:05:01,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"the main argument against him blowing up i think is the rape allegations, he could end up not playing ROS",,,,,

,9/18/2019,16:05:33,12026045322,Ben Deane,But while he’s playing I feel like he has to be in the top 5 wr conversation,,,,,

,9/18/2019,16:11:24,12026045322,Ben Deane,I might be wrong,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:14:08,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,Big Ben is at least a stable human being. ABs lust for attention may reveal information he doesn't intend.,,,,,

,9/18/2019,16:19:24,12026152479,Bryan Lee,i guess there's been a bunch of times where the team has enforced the suspension,,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:21:00,12026045322,Ben Deane,I honestly think this has been a plan from the beginning to be on the pats. I feel like he played everyone,,,Big Ben is at least a stable human being. ABs lust for attention may reveal information he doesn't intend.,9/18/2019,16:14:08

,9/18/2019,16:25:27,15405201430,Kevin Jellerson,I think some of it was certainly intentional. We all knew what was going to happen. But he seems likely to slip up too with these allegations.,,,I think he has his shit together more than people think,9/18/2019,16:21:10

,9/18/2019,16:26:38,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"i mean they're kind of bad, but the thing about the situation is that it seems like the accuser is not being entirely honest",,,,,
,9/18/2019,16:28:02,12026152479,Bryan Lee,"from AB's side they've had multiple consensual sexual encounters and the Britney & her mom were trying to get AB to invest in something of theirs, including some shady stuff of like $300k going towards a house that was owned by the mother",,,,,

,9/23/2019,10:09:25,84986222184,David Casstevens,The thing is that Washington scores in the first half and then putter out so if the bears do what the cowboys and Philly did just go off on the Washington d in the second half then the under is in jeopardy,,,,,
,9/23/2019,10:14:48,84986222184,David Casstevens,Wait so it would be under 49.5,,,,,
,9/23/2019,10:15:12,84986222184,David Casstevens,No 47,,,,,

,9/23/2019,10:18:21,84986222184,David Casstevens,This could be a get right game for bears offense. Second half maybe 17 points and trabisky gets a rushing td to get them going,,,,,

,9/23/2019,11:07:27,84986222184,David Casstevens,But I have a strange feeling about this gane,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:07:27,19176901767,Patrick Deane,If you can get the win it’s worth it,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:07:29,84986222184,David Casstevens,Game,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:07:40,84986222184,David Casstevens,But in the season long,,,,,

,9/23/2019,11:26:33,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Feels easy when you win but it’s not always like this,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:28:21,19176901767,Patrick Deane,I bet you could run some historic data on teases that would help determine likelihood of successes,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:28:29,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,I was telling Dave yesterday with the teases it seems like you should seek out the O/U bets you’re most confident in,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:28:48,15405565554,Mark Casstevens,Then tease the spread second,,,,,
,9/23/2019,11:32:47,19176901767,Patrick Deane,Like what Ben and I were talking about seeing what % of the timing taking the underdog and the under hits,,,,,

Haley got a lot worse last night with couging, wheezing, rattling in her chest, and trouble catching her breath. Well, Haley has a positivr case of the Flu, RSV, and an War infection. Audrey doesnt have a positive influenza test, but does have RSV and an ear infection too. We got the kids flu vaccines last week, which is not enough time for them to fully work, and Haley needs 2 doses for her first time so that was only 1 of 2. The flu is terrible guys especially in babies. Get those flu shots guys.  This looks like it will be a bad season with the number of cases I'm hearing already.",,,,,
