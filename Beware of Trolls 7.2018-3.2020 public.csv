,11/8/2018,8:49:37,removed,Daniella,This might not be the crowd you should ask but I don’t think it makes you homophobic. Sometimes things are uncomfortable and we have long lived in a culture where we have censored gay people and them showing affection. I mean I remember when it was a huge deal to see the first gay kiss on television. I think it might also be uncomfortable for a gay person to see straight people holding hands and kissing because that might be something they cant do where they live. Maybe you need to see it more to get more comfortable.,,,,,

,7/19/2019,13:23:03,removed,Patrick Deane,I also agree that the debates are clown shows... you’re not comparing people on their policies but like Dunc says it’s more about how they handle themselves,,,,,
,7/19/2019,13:27:05,removed,Bryan Lee,"true, you're still getting really bad signal though - you see how they handle themselves in a debate-like setting where it's a popularity contest. The day to day of how you handle yourself in stressful situations is very different, being calm cool and collected is what you want from your leader with so much power and responsibility",,,,,

I don't think this is fair to Kamala Harris, yes she was aggressive but that's how the game is played.  I agree the game is fucked up but you shouldn't fault the candidates for playing it well",,,"Spent all of her time attacking people, playing on people's anger and outrage, eager to wield executive power, disregard for rules",7/19/2019,12:59:19

,7/19/2019,16:20:46,removed,Bryan Lee,"agree with you on the tv/media; i think as long-form content gets more popular on youtube and podcasts, there's light at the end of the tunnel that maybe a candidate like Yang can compete",,,,,

,7/20/2019,22:15:39,removed,Duncan Bell,I say no,,,Is that important to know if we are in a simulation or not?,7/20/2019,22:14:38

,7/20/2019,23:08:53,removed,Bryan Lee,Definitely in a simulation!,,,,,
,7/20/2019,23:11:05,removed,Bryan Lee,There was a recent scientific article about people simulating the big bang and the universe based upon the ability to change some different factors like physical properties. Shortly after the simulation was able to predict what the universe would be like based upon completely different factors they didn't even teach the simulation about and they're still trying to figure out how it's doing it,,,,,

,7/20/2019,23:13:30,removed,Bryan Lee,I also think there's a very decent chance that we're the simulation of an alien race that's 4-dimensional. Or higher dimensional than us.,,,,,
,7/20/2019,23:14:18,removed,Bryan Lee,It's like us being able to create a 2 dimensional simulation with AI. It would be feasible for us sooner. And that 2 dimensional life wouldn't know anything about life in higher dimensions,,,,,

We are immediately faced with the same questions we started with: what created the universe of our creators? Are they also a simulation? When does it stop?

Glad people are actually trying to do this analysis. \nI am curious why they choose to focus on the 40s demographic for their examples though. I feel like the main goal of a wealth tax isn't to address the inequality of wage earners, but on the inequality of wealth.

The scales are of the old balance variety - A small dish hangs from each end of a rod that is balanced in the middle.  The device enables you to determine whether the contents of the dishes weigh the same or that the dish that falls lower has heavier contents than the other.  Not by how much (i.e. it won't tell you if something is twice as heavy as something else),,,,,

If however, all the participants with a white border and only those participants raise their hand, each of the 20 will win $1 million for each white border in the game.

,3/26/2020,10:04:42,removed,Daniella,"The Story\nLawmakers reached an agreement on the biggest stimulus package in US history.\n\nGreat. What does that mean for me?\nIt depends on your situation. Most Americans will get a one-time payment of $1,200. And families get an extra $500 per child. If you make above $75k, you won't get the full $1,200, and those making above $99k don't qualify. The gov will decide how much to give you based on your gross income from your latest tax returns (think: from 2018 or 2019 taxes).\n\nWhat if I'm unemployed?\nThis new package lets more people to qualify for unemployment benefits. Those who lost their jobs would get whatever their state usually provides for unemployment, plus $600 per week for up to four months. And those who aren't typically eligible for benefits including gig workers (think: Uber, Lyft drivers) and freelancers will be covered.\n\nWhen will I get my check?\nFirst, Congress needs to finish voting on the bill. Last night, it passed unanimously in the Senate. Now it goes to the House, where it's expected to pass tomorrow. After that, the timeline for actually getting the checks is unclear. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Americans would receive checks within three weeks. The money could be sent out electronically or by mail.\n\nWhat else does this bill cover?\n$367 billion have been set aside for small businesses (think: for loans to help pay workers or pay rent). $130 billion for hospitals fighting the coronavirus. And industries like airlines can get some relief from the package's $500 billion loan fund. But businesses from the Trump family or any senior gov official don't qualify for loan money.",,,,,
